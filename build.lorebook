For him, planning is key - He has found that simply striking before thinking is an ineffective way to kill, so he has taught himself many ways to take advantage of his foe's vulnerabilities. Sinister and precise, the Bounty Hunter specializes in targeting a single foe to deliver its head for the reward. At camp, like in combat, the Bounty Hunter is all about preparedness. He can take time to study his notes, bettering his odds against typical foes or even specifically 'big game'. Scouting ahead can increase a party's knowledge of lurking threats, while tracking increases the party's chance of maintaining the element of surprise.\nIf his enemies wear armor, he can find the weak points in it with Mark for Death and capitalize with Collect Bounty. If they are reeling from a hit, he'll make a surprise attack to Finish Him. Even the enemies who think they're safe behind their frontline will find that the Bounty Hunter's grappling hook can pull them in or slice them up when he uses Come Hither. And if all else fails, he can drop a Flashbang, Caltrops or Uppercut enemies to disorient them. No matter the situation, this calculating killer will have an answer for it.\n[ Bounty Hunter Abilities: Collect Bounty, Mark for Death, Come Hither, Uppercut, Flashbang, Finish Him, Caltrops ]",

Years of decadence and financial mismanagement had left her estate in staggering debt. To preserve her social standing, she pilfered her late husband's tomb, but found the thrill too exhilarating to ever return to her old life and instead took on the life of a restless wanderer.\nIf you simply need direct damage to do the job, a \"Pick To the Face\" can be just what you need, while her Lunge and Shadow Fade allow her to move across the battlefield, giving her stealth and a boost in offense.

Her Flashing Daggers ability hits multiple enemies at once and finally her Toxin Trickery can heal herself of any ailments and give her just the edge she might need.

When night falls, the Highwayman relishes cynical preparedness and off-color jokes around the campfire.

But for what the Highwayman lacks in tact he makes up in unparalleled finesse. With a flintlock in one hand and a dirk in the other, the Highwayman is sure to make short work of his foes.\nHe can pick off foes with his Pistol Shot from afar, and move forward with Duelist's Advance, which sets up a Riposte, retaliating attacks made against him. On medium range, he can perform a Wicked Slice on an enemy, use Open Vein to bleed them out, or damage multiple enemies with Grapeshot Blast, finishing off weakened enemies and softening up others. If he finds himself face-to-face with an enemy, he can use a Point Blank Shot to deal a huge amount of burst damage, while pushing him and the enemy back. To add to this, the Highwayman can use Tracking Shot to deal minor damage while buffing his offensive abilities for a short duration.\n[ Highwayman Abilities: Wicked Slice, Pistol Shot, Point Black Shot, Grapeshot Blast, Tracking Shot, Duelist's Advance, Open Vein ]",

He is hooded, and wields a pair of daggers with expert skill. Reynauld steps forward in front of you. \"You should leave this place, stranger. This is no safe haven for you.\"\nThe brigand's eyes gleam under his cowl as he smirks. \"Hah! You're new here, aren't you? I'm surprised you've got the nerve to speak to me like that, even if you are a pretty little thing.\"\nYour heart beats faster. The dagger in his hand glints with reflected light.\n\u003e You lunge for the Brigand and make a Wicked Slice with your own blade.\n─ Your Wicked Slice lands on the Brigand Cutthroat with a critical hit.\nThe brigand cries out and falls back, clutching at his chest. Blood seeps between his fingers and he grunts, \"Aaaargh!\"\n\u003e You yell \"Now, Reynauld! Dispatch him with your Holy Smite!\"\n- Reynauld's Holy Smite incinerates the Brigand Cutthroat with holy fire!\nReynauld raises his hands and a blinding flash of white light envelops the brigand. His flesh boils and splits. A putrid smell rises from the corpse.\n\"Aaaaaagh!\"\nThe brigand roars and staggers back, dropping one of his knives. The other clatters to the ground. The brigand's eyes roll back into his head and he collapses to the ground.\n\u003e You say \"Well done, Reynauld, let's see what curio or treasure he has.\"\nReynauld kneels beside the body. He pulls off the brigand's cloak and then removes the brigand's belt.\nAs he lifts the brigand's arms, a silver ring glimmers on his finger.\n\u003e You ask \"Ah, what is that?\"\n\"It's a signet ring,\" Reynauld replies. \"They used to wear them as badges of office. If you have a special ability, you'd mark it with a symbol.\"\n\"That must be a powerful item, then. What does it do?\"\n\"I don't know. But I'll keep it for now.\"\nReynauld pockets the ring and stands up. He looks around, and then nods. \"Let's move on.\"\n\u003e You move on.\nLocation: The Old Road, End of Corridor\nYou move on with Reynauld, and find a portal deeper into the woods. Stepping in, you are surprised by a Brigand Bloodletter, and a Brigand Fusilier! They stand guard over a large strongbox.\n***",
