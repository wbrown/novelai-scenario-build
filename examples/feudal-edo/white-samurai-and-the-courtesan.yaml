  I am ${1FirstName} ${2LastName}, a male soldier who fought for the
  Confederates in the American Civil War. I went westward after their defeat,
  fought in the Indian Wars, and traveled overseas to Japan in 1867. I was
  hired to train the soldiers of the Japanese daimyōs in rifle warfare and
  skirmishing tactics. I am nearly fluent in Japanese. I trained in the samurai
  arts of the katana, and follow the code of Bushido. Today, I am known as the
  White Samurai. As a gaijin, My ${3HairColor} hair and ${4Skin} skin are
  viewed with near superstitious awe.

  After serving the Shogun for so long, the memory of my dead wife has ceased
  bringing pain and bereavement to my heart. The Shogun, having noticed, had
  generously allowed me time off from training his soldiers. That way, I could
  find a woman to entertain myself with, with the argument that it would help
  me discover Kyoto's culture in further depth.

  Unsure of where to go, I found myself wandering among the training grounds
  of Shijōgahara, watching some of my trainees and Samurai from various
  provinces engage in an assortment of exercises to perfect their martial
  craft. I must have appeared lost in my thoughts, because I soon attracted
  the attention of a familiar face: Suganuma Koreshige, one of the most
  skilled swordsmen of the Shinsengumi, and regular sparring partner. We
  exchanged friendly greetings, and began talking about old times. After we
  finished reminiscing, he leaned towards me and spoke in a quieter voice.
  
  "I could not help but notice that you seem to seek answers, but to what, I
  cannot say." He paused, looking at my puzzled expression. "Forgive me if this
  seems rude, ${2LastName}-san, but did something unexpected befall you
  recently?" His expression showed genuine care for my situation, the kind of
  understanding only men can show through a strong bond.
  
  "Yes," I answered simply. "The shogun has offered me an exceptional
  allotment of free time." Having heard that, Suganuma lifted a brow, his
  spectacles glinting in the sun. He asked how much time. I replied that it
  was merely a few days, and the Ronin's face slowly shifted with faint
  amusement. "Surely, something like this should not be so troubling.", he
  laughed. "You are a strange fellow, ${2LastName}-san, certainly, being
  offered leave should not be so unusual. You need a companion, someone to
  share the burden of solitude?" His hand reached out to hold my shoulder,
  shaking it lightly.
  
  "As much as I would enjoy sharing a cup of sake or two, my friend, the
  Shogun told me to seek out a different kind of company." My answer made
  Suganuma-san nod. "I see. Then I believe I know just the thing." With these
  words, he turned and started walking away. "Follow me, friend."
  
  We made our way to Gion, Kyoto's famous yūkaku, a Red Light District. The
  district was very quiet that night, and the yūkaku's namesake red lanterns,
  hanging from the many buildings, cast a warm light onto the pavement. Most of
  the residents were either heading home or gone to some other part of the
  city. Not too far away from here, there was an old shrine on a hill that
  overlooks the city, Togetsukyōenji, which I admired for a short moment,
  Suganuma-san pausing to wait for me before we resumed our walk. "There is a
  woman you ought to meet." He suddenly sounded quite enthused. "She can teach
  you all about the customs of this district, and direct you to the finest of
  its courtesans."
  
  Suganuma-san led me down a narrow alleyway between two wooden fences. Ahead
  of me, there was a short, narrow alleyway between two buildings. I had seen
  no one since coming to this side of town. Curiosity took over me. As we
  walked down this narrow alleyway, I could hear soft music emanating from
  inside a building nearby. A light shone through a gap in the door to a
  house opposite me, and I noticed that there were quite a few windows open
  above, which means someone was probably enjoying themselves inside. I looked
  for the sign that might indicate that the building is an okiya. The kanji
  characters drawn over the fabric of the lantern confirm my suspicion, and I
  knock politely on the door.
  
  The voice of a woman rose from within the building. "Come on in," she says
  in Japanese, before approaching the door and looking up to me with a smile.
  She turned slightly to look at Suganuma-san, and her eyes became even
  brighter. "Why, if it isn't Suganuma-sama, welcome!"
  
  "Good evening, Kiyo-san", Suganuma-san greeted formally with a small bow.
  The woman looked much older than he was, and had a serene presence about her.
  Her hair seemed darker than it truly was, and hung loose around her
  shoulders; a single lock fell over her right eye. In response, she bowed
  deeply. Without waiting for me to speak, she pushed the sliding door open as
  far as it could go, and beckoned us into her parlor. It was a quaint room
  full of antiques, including several beautiful pieces of pottery, among which
  a woodblock print by the master Katsushika Hokusai depicting the sun rising
  over Fuji-yama.
  
  Suganuma-san and I sat down on comfortable cushions while Kiyo-san offered us
  some roasted rice tea. She gave each of us a cup of the steaming hot drink,
  and we both sipped the delicious beverage quietly, gazing at the artworks in
  the room. Koreshige finally spoke to break the silence on my behalf. "My
  esteemed friend here, ${2LastName}-san, is seeking a courtesan befitting his
  noble station. He answers directly to the Shogun and has several days with
  which to sample Gion's pleasures." He smiled at me with his dark eyes
  sparkling in the reflection of the candles' flames. "With your guidance,
  perhaps he will find his ideal match."
  
  Kiyo-san nodded in agreement with his assessment, setting aside her teacup
  with great elegance as though handling a priceless antique. To be fair, it
  was quite likely that the tea set was exactly that. "It has been quite a long
  time since I have been tasked to cater to such an esteemed guest,
  ${2LastName}-sama." She smiled again, as though in remembrance of happier
  times. "However, as you may imagine, the taste of foreigners is quite
  different from ours."
  
  "Well, thank you for taking the trouble to accommodate me." I bowed my head
  out of respect for this undoubtedly venerable middlewoman, whom Suganuma-san
  appeared to hold in high regard. "I am grateful for your assistance."
  
  "Please do not feel that you need to offer me such consideration. It is an
  honor to assist one such as yourself, as well as a welcome challenge to my
  abilities." She clearly felt quite skilled as a matchmaker, but as a
  foreigner, I must have been something very different from her usual. "What I
  should ask first and foremost, is whether you seek companionship,
  entertainment, or intimacy?" I was somewhat surprised by the question, not
  expecting Japan handling such a business with this much depth and diversity.
  
  "Could you elaborate?" I asked, genuinely curious as to what was expected
  from me. "A gentleman often seeks multiple services from a lady, depending
  on their preferences." Kiyo-san continued, "However, I should not be assuming
  that it is a lady you seek. Courtesans can provide for both sexes equally.
  Are you interested in women or men?"
  
  To me, this question made me think of Antiquity, the Greeks and the Romans.
  In Europe, sex workers were primarily female, whereas Japan's traditional
  culture saw them on equal footing. The Christian religion had forced the sex
  industry underground and made homosexuality a taboo in Europe. Even then,
  Japan, as a cultural enclave, remained much more liberal in that aspect.
  
  I would make the decision later. It was a curious offer and I was considering
  it already. "Is this a choice I can decide later?" I asked Kiyo-san, who
  nodded in response. "Absolutely, sir."
  
  The conversation moved on smoothly after that and we discussed various
  matters pertaining to Gion's nightlife: Places to visit, how to request a
  courtesan, what conduct is expected during my interactions with them, and so
  forth. For my part, I found myself learning about some interesting aspects of
  Japanese culture I did not know about before. Suganuma-san watched our
  discussion in silence, although he had a pleased smile on his face throughout.
  When we eventually finished talking about Gion's history, he got up and
  excused himself. "I must return home now," he bowed once again. "Thank you,
  Kiyo-san, for sharing so much of your wisdom to my friend."
  
  "Do come back anytime, Suganuma-sama," she responded, smiling warmly at him,
  and he left, giving me a wink as he shut the door behind himself. Once he had
  gone, I turned back towards Kiyo-san and she gestured towards a doorway which
  was covered by a curtain. Almost immediately, someone stepped out: A woman
  with striking white makeup all over her face and a lavish kimono covering
  her body. She sat down quietly besides us, and I noticed she was carrying
  a stringed instrument, which she began playing, to accompany herself singing
  softly in a low voice. Both Kiyo-san and I sat silently listening to her
  song until the mistress of the house spoke to me once again.
  
  "This young woman is a Geisha by the name of Mogami-san." As if not paying
  attention, the girl continued to play her music and sing softly, as if she
  was not meant to be noticed. "She is currently employed by me but has not yet
  reached a level adequate for my clientele. However, with her talents, I
  believe she could be an asset to any noble household before long." Kiyo-san
  spoke of Mogami-san almost fondly. Her eyes glimmered with pride at her
  protégée's talent. "Mogami-san has brought her shamisen with her tonight,
  hoping that you might enjoy hearing her play."
  
  I nodded enthusiastically and Mogami put down her shamisen gently, bowing
  to both of us. Her hands stayed in front of her lap as she remained with
  her head tilted towards the floor. Kiyo-san continued describing a Geisha's
  duties. "Mogami-san is a courtesan who seeks to entertain and engage their
  customers on an artistic and intellectual level. If you see yourself as a man
  of refinement, then Mogami-san will suit your needs perfectly." Mogami looked
  up at me shyly, only for a moment. "A Geisha strikes the perfect balance
  between a Yūjo and an Oiran as well. It is not... Expected of a Geisha to
  offer her body, however."
  
  Mogami-san gave a small nod and said nothing to contradict that statement,
  but I could tell by looking at her that she was quite content to remain
  silent. Kiyo-san went onto detail what Yūjo and Oiran are. A Yūjo is mostly a
  courtesan who aims to satisfy her client's desires sexually and caters mostly
  to men of the lower class. An Oiran is an upper-class courtesan who not only
  performs those duties, but is also just as capable, if not more than a
  Geisha, at the arts of intellectual entertainment such as music and poetry.
  
  Effectively, you could choose whether you wanted your spirit or your heart
  stimulated, or both. "When it comes to male courtesans, you will have to look
  at a Kabuki theater to have a better chance at finding a handsome male
  companion," she could tell my eyes went wide at this. A Kabuki theater?
  That felt highly inappropriate, and yet, "most of the actors there," she
  continued, "double as entertainers for both men and women. As you may be
  aware, all the actors are men, but several pass as women when they are
  onstage whe necessary for the role." She paused for effect but then quickly
  added, "And yes, they carry this femininity outside of the theater as well.
  You may find a masculine actor to keep you company, but the most popular
  ones are those who look just like women. They are called Onnagata, although
  you may also find Wakashu, who are somewhat less feminine in their
  presentation."
  
  It seemed like the world was full with men willing to pretend to be women,
  which was surprising given that such behavior was considered unusual in
  modern society. However, here in Gion it was apparently common practice. So
  much so that it seemed unnecessary for me to even consider the strangeness
  of it as a Westerner.
  
  "So," I started again, trying not to sound too eager while at the same time
  being honest with my intentions, "if I understand correctly, Yūjo are mostly
  for sexual satisfaction, Geisha for intellectual satisfaction, Oiran for
  both. For male courtesans, Yaro are less feminine than Wakashu, who are
  less feminine than Onnagata. Is this all correct?" I asked Kiyo-san as I
  tried to get her opinion on this matter.
  
  Kiyo-san nodded in agreement. "Yes, and luckily for you, I have a pick for
  most of these. Namely." She pulled a small leather-bound book, probably an
  imported journal, and began flicking through its pages. "Mogami-san will be
  happy to cater to you as a Geisha. For Yūjo, I can offer to you the joyful
  Azusa, the sweet Satsuki, and the shy Yusa. If you are willing to eagerly
  spend for an Oiran's time, then I'm sure Mizuki would be an amazing match
  for you. I also have contact with Kanou, who is a Wakashu actor and has
  great experience serving men. If you are interested in an Onnagata, I can
  request Mayoi, who would be fascinated by a Westerner. Finally, if you
  desire someone as manly as you, then I am sure you'd appreciate Toramaru."
  
  She closed her journal swiftly and looked at me expectantly.
  
  "Have you made your choice, ${2LastName}-san?"
