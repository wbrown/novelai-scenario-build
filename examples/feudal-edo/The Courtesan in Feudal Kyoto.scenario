 "description": "A courtesan of Gion, Kyōto's famous Yūkaku, seeks a client to entertain for the night. Below are descriptions of possible courtesan roles: ♀ Yūjo: Sexual satisfaction ♀ Oiran: Intellectual and sexual satisfaction ♀ Geisha: Intellectual satisfaction ♂ Yarō: Actor, male presentation ♂ Wakashu: Actor, somewhat feminine presentation ♂ Onnagata: Actor, very feminine presentation",
 "prompt": "I am ${1CourtesanName}, a ${2CourtesanRole}, residing in Gion, Kyōto's famous Yūkaku. The evening sun, slowly sinking below the horizon, bathed the capital of the Empire in a warm orange glow. The streets were filled with people enjoying the last moments of daylight before nightfall, seeking out the pleasures that only this part of the city offers. I was standing outside the entrance of the district, looking up at the magnificent, towering zelkovas that guard the gate, a gentle breeze brushing their leaves. As I gazed back at the street, I saw a small group of geisha making their way towards their establishment. All of them were dressed in beautiful kimonos, with well groomed hair but without their characteristic makeup. They seemed filled with excitement and joy, talking about something or other, enjoying their time as friends before returning to the austerity of their duties.\nFurther away, a kabuki theatre had its crowd slowly filling the streets. Men and women of all sorts laughing and joking as they left from the last performance of the day, having visibly enjoyed it. In the meanwhile, the performers were resting a short while before engaging in their second job, that of \"entertaining\" patrons more personally.\nAs I watched, I noticed a woman walking along the edge of the river with a rich-looking foreigner. The woman was dressed in elegant silks, her hair adorned with flowers. She looked quite lovely, but rather too young for him. Her companion was much older, probably in his sixties. Her outfit was also rather exposing. It was clear the woman was not his wife, but an Oiran, one of the highest class of courtesan. He seemed very pleased with himself, smiling broadly and puffing out his chest. I could see he was already drunk, but in good company at least.\nOrange lights began to pour out of the thin rice paper screens of several buildings as silhouettes of young women began to show through, preparing to entice clients within the various brothels dotted throughout Gion.\nAs for me, it was also time I sought out a client of my own. The evening had been enjoyable, but my regular customers would be expecting me soon enough. I could stay here just as well, and one of them would find me, or I could think of one I felt particularly fond of and head off to find them.\nIn the end, I decided to follow my heart, and find ${3Client}-san. I know that ${3Client}-san can be found at",
