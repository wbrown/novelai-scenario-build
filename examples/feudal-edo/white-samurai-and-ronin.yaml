  After serving the Shogun throughout the year, I began to notice the Shogunate
  fraying at the seams. The nobility grew restless at Shogun Tokugawa's
  wide-reaching reforms. It was becoming clear as day that he had consolidated
  such power that no one could challenge him. At this point, the Tokugawa
  lineage had become stronger than that of the Emperor's dynasty. This was a
  time of great uncertainty and unrest: The Imperial Court is weak and
  ineffective, and the Shogunate grows increasingly dominant. Tokugawa is
  concerned that the powerful nobles in support of the Emperor will rebel
  against him and depose him. He needs a strong ally.
  
  Having allied himself to some degree with the French and the British, it is
  now time for the Shogun to take a stand. He decides to make a bold move,
  receiving arms and experts to train his troops in the art of modern warfare.
  Samurai now wield revolvers in addition to their sabres. Infantry lines of
  riflemen are becoming increasingly popular among the Daimyōs' forces as they
  attempt to consolidate their hold on their domains. Many Daimyōs have sent
  their sons overseas to be taught Western languages and sciences in order to
  guarantee the modernity of their legacy. Japan is entering a new era, and
  fast.
  
  The Shogun not only recruited advisors and weapons from abroad, but also
  recruited me to train his troops. For months, I have been training the
  daimyōs' infantry. The Japanese troops are disciplined and receptive to the
  changes brought by modernity. Although they are often described as stiff
  and traditionalist, the Samurai and the rest of the troops I trained always
  showed a keen interest in the innovations I introduced. Almost fascinated by
  the possibilities of what they can learn, and how they might change the
  world. Compared to soldiers in the United States who simply wished to be
  given a gun and told how to use it and keep it working, the Japanese
  soldiers would take considerable time disassembling and studying their
  weapons, asking themselves and each other questions on how they functioned.
  This not only led them to develop a form of respect for their expensive
  weapons, but also make keen-eyed observations that led them to handle said
  weapons with greater care.
  
  The Shogun's troops are disciplined and respectful. They treat their
  equipment with great care, and follow orders without question. In the face of
  danger, they are willing to sacrifice their lives for the sake of their
  mission. They are brave, honorable, and loyal to their lord. It is a pleasure
  to teach them. At first, the Shogun was hesitant about adopting modern
  weaponry. After all, he wanted to maintain the integrity of the samurai
  tradition. Yet, after seeing the results of fire arms on expertly-crafted
  armor, and how any peasant could be trained to be a skilled rifle operator
  in less than a month, the Shogun realized that his troops needed to be armed
  with the latest technology if they were going to endure the coming conflicts.
  
  Even then, the Emperor's supporters are wealthy and just as interested in
  keeping up with the times as the Shogun is. The Emperor is a man of peace,
  and has little interest in war, but his faction is growing in influence. They
  are determined to give him the power and influence he is owed as the
  descendant of Amaterasu-no-Kami. The Shogun has been forced to adopt many
  reforms in order to protect himself and his family. He is struggling to find
  a way to appease both sides. The daimyōs are aching for a fight, but Tokugawa
  refuses to let Japan descend into bloodshed.
  
  As several daimyōs were assassinated in the recent years, a special force
  was created. Its objective was twofold: To protect the interests of the
  Shogunate by guarding its dignitaries, and to contain the growing ronin
  population. Its name: The Shinsengumi. They are impressive in their own
  right. A group of isolated warriors from all across Japan, yet they share
  a common purpose and goal. They have formed into a cohesive unit that follows
  the rules of Bushido. They are dedicated to protecting the Shogun and the
  daimyōs, far more than you would expect of a ragtag group of ronin. Their
  loyalty to the Shogun is unquestionable. They are experts that far surpass
  the skills of your average soldier. In a melee, a single one is enough to
  take down an entire squad of regular infantry. Merely being present around
  a daimyō is enough to deter most assassins.
  
  However, this may not remain true forever. My contact with the Shinsengumi,
  Suganuma Koreshige, has been growing more and more strained over the past few
  months. His fellows are becoming restless, and he has been unable to quell
  their discontent. It seems clear that the tide is starting to turn in favor
  of the Emperor's forces, and soon the Shogunate may crumble.
  
  I met Suganuma-san in front of Togetsukyōenji that evening. His expression
  was grim behind his spectacles. He looked like the recent weeks had taken a
  toll on him. "${2LastName}-san, it is a relief to see you healthy and well,
  my friend." He voice was firm as ever, but a hint of sadness lingered in his
  eyes. "I have heard of trouble stirring outside of Kyoto. Some daimyōs are
  increasingly fearing for the lives. I would rush to assist, but I must admit
  I am in a dire predicament, and I must ask for your help." He immediately
  bowed quite deeply, showing how intense his need for aid was.
  
  "What sort of trouble?" I inquired, to which he straightened himself up and
  reached out to take me by the shoulder. "Let us discuss this matter in more
  discreet company."
  ***
  It was a cool evening. The wind whistled through the streets of Kyōto,
  carrying the smell of the river. We walked along the banks of the Kamo River.
  It was quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Suganuma-san spoke
  softly, as if afraid of being overheard. "I cannot go into detail, but I fear
  that the Shinsengumi is slowly losing control of the situation. The daimyōs
  are becoming increasingly restless, and so are my fellow ronin. I am unsure
  how much longer we can keep our heads above water."
  
  "Why do you say that?" I asked. "Are there signs of rebellion?"
  
  He shook his head. "Not exactly. I would not call it rebellion. I would call
  it the spirit of Yamato slowly turning my fellows into protectors of the
  Emperor. As I am sure you are aware, the Imperial clan is weakening. With
  the Shogun having adopted modern technology, the Emperor is no longer able
  to hide his weakness. I understand that Tokugawa knows what is best for the
  nation, but his authority has grown so strong that the Emperor is practically
  gathering a faction of his own. Soon, the Emperor will have the support of
  the daimyōs who have understood the tide is turning. I believe that there is
  a desire to return to the Empire's original order that is starting to divide
  the whole nation."
  
  I was surprised. I had not expected the Shogun to be in such dire straits.
  "I see. Is that why you are requesting my assistance?" Suganuma-san nodded.
  "The Shinsengumi cannot be trusted any more. I need someone that I can rely
  on. I can vouch for your honesty and reliability. If you agree to help, I
  shall provide you with the means to service Ue-sama's cause. I am certain
  that if the Shogunate comes to a dire end, he will be able to provide you
  with comfortable accommodations, should you wish to stay in his employ."
  
  I thought it over. This offer was too good to be true. It seemed that the
  Shogun was planning something big, but I could not tell what it was. "What is
  Ue-sama's plan?" I tried to question Suganuma-san, but he shook his head in
  response. "I am afraid that I cannot disclose the details, for I am not even
  privy to them myself. But I know that it is important enough to risk my life
  and the lives of my comrades."
  
  "I see. Then I shall trust you, Suganuma-san." I reached out to take his
  hand, and he shook mine. "${2LastName}-san, I need you to help me protect
  Ue-sama's right hand. I have reason to believe that his Shinsengumi retinue
  will soon become divided. The soldiers will begin to question the direction
  of their lord. You must ensure that they remain loyal to the Shogun, or be
  convinced to leave. By diplomacy or by blade, I need your help to keep the
  daimyō safe. Can I trust you to do this?"
  
  "Yes, I understand," I answered with conviction. "I am honored to be given
  such a task. I will gladly help you."
  
  "Good. We shall depart as soon as possible. We are heading for Nagoya and
  must reach it as soon as can be. I fear for the safety of the daimyō. We
  must hurry." We departed from Kyōto at dawn the next day. Our destination
  was Nagoya, but I asked Suganuma-san to let us mark a stop in Yokosuka so
  that I may visit Anjin-sama's grave to pay my respects and ask for guidance.
  We made it to Yokosuka before nightfall. It was a beautiful city, but we had
  little time to spare. We spent the night in an inn upon arrival, then
  immediately left at daybreak for the cemetery. At this time of day, it was
  completely deserted. There were no other visitors here except for us. I knelt
  down in front of Anjin-sama's grave and bowed my head in reverence. As the
  first Westerner to become a Samurai, Anjin-sama had great respect for Japan's
  potential. Just as I am, he worked for the Tokugawa Shogunate, two hundred
  and fifty years ago, while it was still in its infancy.
  
  "Thank you for giving me the chance to become a Samurai, Anjin-sama. I hope
  that I will prove worthy of your legacy." I felt a small lump in my throat
  as I said these words. I bowed once more and stood up. "I must continue on
  my journey now." I turned to face Suganuma-san once again. "Suganuma-san,
  please rest assured that I will protect the Shogun's interests with all my
  strength. Let us proceed."
  
  "I will be praying for our success, and that of the Shogun's cause,"
  Suganuma-san replied.

  We arrived in Nagoya the following day. It was late afternoon when we finally
  set foot in the city. Laying on the shore of the Bay of Ise, Nagoya was a
  prosperous port city, and its harbor bustled with activity. It was a
  strategic location for the Shogunate.
  
  Nagoya Castle was located in the center of the city. It was built on a hill
  overlooking the bay, and the view from atop it was magnificent. We made our
  way towards the castle and climbed the steep stairs leading to the top. From
  there, we looked out over the city.
  
  "This is a splendid view," Suganuma-san wistfully remarked. "Every mission of
  mine lets me see how gorgeous Yamato is. I never tire of it." "It certainly
  is beautiful," I agreed. "Protecting its unity is one of the most important
  duties of a Samurai." He turned to look at me. "Indeed. That is why our
  mission is of paramount importance."
  
  "Of course," I replied. "Which of the Shinsengumi guard are you wary of in
  Nagoya?" "I'm not sure yet. I want to make a careful assessment of the
  situation. It is difficult to know how much danger we might be in. It is
  possible that all of them are suspect, but I doubt it." I pondered his words
  for a moment. "The Shinsengumi are a highly disciplined group, and they
  always act in unison. Discord in the group would need to be extremely
  serious for any of them to be disloyal. Would that mean that there is a
  group of Shinsengumi who are plotting against the daimyō?"
  
  Suganuma-san took off his spectacles, wiping them clean with a cloth he took
  from his pocket. He put them back on and gazed out over the city. "Yes, it is
  possible that they are. The daimyōs are growing increasingly concerned about
  their own personal guard. Perhaps the ronin are merely doubtful currently,
  and not planning something dishonorable yet. It is possible we may solve
  this problem without bloodshed, but we cannot discard the possibility of
  violence."
  
  We watch over Nagoya for some time before turning back towards the castle.
  It is time for us to choose how we will proceed.
