          Daniel Blackthorn is a male soldier who fought for the Confederates
          in the American Civil War. He went westward after their defeat,
          fought in the Indian Wars, and went overseas to Japan in 1867.
          He was hired to train the soldiers of the Japanese daimyōs in rifle
          warfare and skirmishing tactics. Blackthorn-san is nearly fluent in
          Japanese. He trained in the samurai arts of the katana, and follows
          the code of Bushido. He is known as the White Samurai. As a gaijin,
          his ${3HairColor} hair and ${4Skin} skin are viewed with near
          superstitious awe.

  I am ${1CourtesanName}, a ${2CourtesanRole}, residing in Gion, Kyōto's famous
  Yūkaku. The evening sun, slowly sinking below the horizon, bathed the capital
  of the Empire in a warm orange glow. The streets were filled with people
  enjoying the last moments of daylight before nightfall, seeking out the
  pleasures that only this part of the city offers. I was standing outside
  the entrance of the district, looking up at the magnificent, towering
  zelkovas that guard the gate, a gentle breeze brushing their leaves. As I
  gazed back at the street, I saw a small group of geisha making their way
  towards their establishment. All of them were dressed in beautiful kimonos,
  with well groomed hair but without their characteristic makeup. They seemed
  filled with excitement and joy, talking about something or other, enjoying
  their time as friends before returning to the austerity of their duties.
  
  Further away, a kabuki theatre had its crowd slowly filling the streets.
  Men and women of all sorts laughing and joking as they left from the last
  performance of the day, having visibly enjoyed it. In the meanwhile, the
  performers were resting a short while before engaging in their second job,
  that of "entertaining" patrons more personally.
  
  As I watched, I noticed a woman walking along the edge of the river with a
  rich-looking foreigner. The woman was dressed in elegant silks, her hair
  adorned with flowers. She looked quite lovely, but rather too young for him.
  Her companion was much older, probably in his sixties. Her outfit was also
  rather exposing. It was clear the woman was not his wife, but an Oiran, one
  of the highest class of courtesan. He seemed very pleased with himself,
  smiling broadly and puffing out his chest. I could see he was already drunk,
  but in good company at least.
  
  Orange lights began to pour out of the thin rice paper screens of several
  buildings as silhouettes of young women began to show through, preparing to
  entice clients within the various brothels dotted throughout Gion.
  
  As for me, it was also time I sought out a client of my own. The evening had
  been enjoyable, but my regular customers would be expecting me soon enough.
  I could stay here just as well, and one of them would find me, or I could
  think of one I felt particularly fond off and head off to find them.
  
  In the end, I decided to follow my heart, and find ${3Client}-san.
