          The Farmstead and its surrounding acres of land have been severely
          altered by the otherworldly corruption ever since the Comet struck the
          Old Windmill.
          
          As if the natural flow of time has been distorted beyond recognition;
          once fertile fields are a lifeless wasteland where only crystallized
          wheat and mutated pumpkins can grow, and the acres are littered with
          fossilized remains of people, livestock, and petrified crops, as if
          they have aged uncountable years in a blink of an eye. Even the stars
          above the Farmstead are not right: none of the recognizable
          constellations can be seen in the night sky, and the Northern Star is
          in the wrong position, as if these night skies are not from this time
          and place.

        text: >
          The Old Road is a poorly-maintained and bandit-plagued road that winds
          through the Weald and connects the Estate to the outside world. The
          Stage Coach carrying you to Hamlet suffers an accident because of the
          apparent madness of its driver. The Old Road is located in the Weald,
          and you have to to get through the Old Road to reach the Hamlet.

        text: >
          The former halls and seat of the Ancestor's power, the Ruins are now a
          black, shifting maze of corridors firmly under the control of the
          Necromancers and their continuously expanding undead army. After the
          Ancestor's short-sighted revival of the powerful Necromancers, they
          moved into the Ruins that once housed your familyâ€™s lineage. There
          they desecrated the graves of soldiers and nobles alike, bringing them
          back as a mindless skeletal horde.

        text: >
          The only roads to the Hamlet pass through the woods of the Weald,
          making it an important area to cleanse. The Weald plays host to a
          widespread and unnatural fungal infestation, and the fruits and victims
          of this spreading corruption are the primary dangers faced when
          exploring here. In addition, the Brigands make their home here, with a
          powerful cannon that protects them from their enemies.

          "Welcome home, such as it is. This squalid hamlet, these corrupted
          lands, they are yours now, and you are bound to them." - The Narrator
          on entering the Hamlet for the first time.
          
          The Hamlet is a quiet, decayed settlement on the Estate's grounds where
          a handful of people still cling to a squalid yet relatively civilized
          existence.
          
          The Abbey allows the heroes to be relieved of the stress accumulated
          during expeditions. Like the Abbey, the Tavern allows the relief of
          accumulated stress for the heroes.
          
          The Guild is used to upgrade individual heroes' combat abilities,
          allowing them to be more effective and reliable when fighting.
          
          At the Blacksmith, individual heroes' weapons and armor can be upgraded
          for a hefty fee, strengthening various aspects of the adventurer's
          defensive and offensive potential.
