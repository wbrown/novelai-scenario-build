          'Welcome home, such as it is. This squalid hamlet, these corrupted
          lands, they are yours now, and you are bound to them.'

          The Hamlet is a quiet, decayed settlement on the Estate's grounds
          where a handful of people still cling to a squalid yet relatively
          civilized existence. Two buildings are dedicated to easing the minds
          of its visitors: the Tavern, where heroes can drink, gamble, or visit
          the brothel, and the Abbey, allowing heroes to meditate, pray, or
          flagellate themselves. At the Blacksmith, weapons and armor can be
          bought for a hefty fee, while the Guild is more than eager to train
          with those that can pay their tuition.

          'Brigands have run of these lanes. Keep to the side-path, the Hamlet
          is just ahead.'

          The Old Road is a poorly-maintained and bandit-plagued road that
          connects the Estate to the outside world. It is the only in and out
          of these plagued lands; Travelers often get beset by the bandits
          who made this place their home. New arrivals coming by the Stage
          Coach often suffer accidents because of the apparent madness of its
          drivers.

          'The fiends must be driven back. And what better place to begin than
          the seat of our noble line?'

          The Ruins are the crumbling remains of the Ancestor's estate. All
          that remains of its former glory is a black, shifting maze of
          corridors; Firmly under the control of the Necromancers. The walls
          of the Ruins are adorned with the fading emblems of the Ancestor
          and bookshelves full of old, leather-bound books. The cold air is
          filled with the stale smell of dust and abandonment. You can hear a
          faint chanting in the background, just gnawing at the edge of your
          mind.

          'Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life from these
          groves. Let us burn out this evil.'

          The Weald is a stagnant, overgrown forest inhabited by bandits and
          the victims of parasitic fungus. The fruits and victims of this
          spreading corruption are the primary dangers faced when exploring
          here. In addition, the Brigands make their home in the Weald,
          backed by a powerful cannon that protects them from their enemies.
          The trees are misshaping and covered in the fungous infection
          spread by the local witches. The smell of rotting carcasses and the
          sound of rabid wolves howling fills the air.

          'They breed quickly down there in the dark, but perhaps we can
          slay them even faster.'

          The Warrens are an incredibly ancient system of aqueducts and tunnels
          built for an unknown purpose. It is a corpse- choked cesspit that
          houses the ravenous, disease-ridden beast-men known as the Swinefolk
          and their allies. The ancient walls of the Warrens are beginning to
          crumble, while the tunnels are littered with barrels full of
          foul-smelling liquids and carts filled with human half-eaten human
          remains. The stench of those corpses, mixed with the smell of refuse,
          permeates the air. Always in the background, you can hear the
          constant squealing and screeching of the pig-men.

          'These salt-soaked caverns are teeming with pelagic nightmares -
          they must be flushed out!'

          The Cove is a twisted, maze-like cavern close to the ocean. Its
          otherworldly tunnels house an ancient race of fish-men, called the
          Pelagic, as well as the Drowned - undead sailors cursed to relive
          the moment of their death. The smell of rotten fish is almost
          unbearable; a constant reminder of the nearby sea. The sound of
          dripping water echoes through the Cove's passages. Eerie shimmering
          corals provide the only natural light around here, while unholy
          idols and the remains of destroyed ships lay scattered on the stony
          cave-floor.
