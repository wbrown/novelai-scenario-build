          'Welcome home, such as it is. This squalid hamlet, these corrupted
          lands, they are yours now, and you are bound to them.'

          The Hamlet is a quiet, decayed settlement on the Estate's grounds
          where a handful of people still cling to a squalid yet relatively
          civilized existence. Two buildings are dedicated to easing the minds
          of its visitors: the Tavern, where heroes can drink, gamble, or visit
          the brothel, and the Abbey, allowing heroes to meditate, pray, or
          flagellate themselves. At the Blacksmith, weapons and armor can be
          bought for a hefty fee, while the Guild is more than eager to train
          with those that can pay their tuition.

          'Brigands have run of these lanes. Keep to the side-path, the Hamlet
          is just ahead.'

          The Old Road is a poorly-maintained and bandit-plagued road that
          winds through the Weald and connects the Estate to the outside world.
          It is the only in and out of these plagued lands; Travelers often get
          beset by the bandits who made this place their home. New arrivals
          coming by the Stage Coach often suffer accidents because of the
          apparent madness of its drivers.

          'The fiends must be driven back. And what better place to begin than
          the seat of our noble line?'

          The Ruins are a crumbling castle, and the former halls and seat of
          the Ancestor's power are now a black, shifting maze of corridors
          firmly under the control of the Necromancers. They desecrated the
          graves of soldiers and nobles alike, bringing them back as a
          mindless skeletal horde. Scattered scraps of faith to give comfort to
          the masses are strew along its shifted corridors and sloped vaults.
          Bookshelves full of old, leather-bound books can be found here. The
          holy altars and fountains seem almost out of place against the
          backdrop of corruption.

          'Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life from these
          groves. Let us burn out this evil.'

          The Weald is a stagnant, overgrown forest inhabited by bandits and
          the victims of parasitic fungus. The fruits and victims of this
          spreading corruption are the primary dangers faced when exploring
          here. In addition, the Brigands make their home here, with a powerful
          cannon that protects them from their enemies. Nature herself is a
          victim to this spreading corruption: malformed with misintent. Paths
          and roads bring soldiers and supplies to reduce the isolation of the
          troubled estate.

          'They breed quickly down there in the dark, but perhaps we can slay
          them even faster.'

          The Warrens are an incredibly ancient system of aqueducts and tunnels
          built for an unknown purpose. It is now a corpse-choked cesspit that
          houses the ravenous, disease-ridden beast-men known as the Swinefolk,
          and all those deranged or monstrous enough to ally with them. While
          the Ancestor was trying his hand at blood rituals, he used the
          ancient Warrens as a dumping grounds for his failures and
          underwhelming results. Barrels that reeks of powerful liquors as well
          as carts full of human remains can be found here.

          'These salt-soaked caverns are teeming with pelagic nightmares -
          they must be flushed out!'

          The Cove is a twisted, cavernous maze near the sea. Its eerie tunnels
          house an ancient race of fish-men, called the Pelagic, as well as
          the Drowned - undead sailors cursed to relive he moment of their
          death. The smell of rotten fish is almost unbearable, but despite
          its morbid aspect, this place seems almost traversable. The Ancestor
          once used the Cove as a means to deliver some of his more
          controversial artifacts, as well as a location to perform his pacts
          with the ancient beings in the water when money was scarce. Eerie
          Corals, unholy idols and the remains of destroyed ships adorn these
          sinister tunnels.

        text: >
          'Soaked and sinking, these stone terraces and sprawling gardens are
           the site of long forgotten revelry...and well remembered regret.'

          The Courtyard houses the former lavish gardens and vistas of the
          estate, fallen to ruin and overtaken by a terrible, bloody
          insect-borne infestation and its depraved victims. The constant
          buzzing of insects as well as the eerie glow, called Bloodlight, of
          this place, only enhanced this place's malevolent aura. Don't be
          fooled by the calm appearance of the Courtyard. Thronging Hive's and
          Throbbing Coccoons, filled with bloodthirsty insects can be found
          around every corner.

          'Some blazing malevolence from beyond the stars has crashed upon the
          Miller’s farm. Lands that have, in past years, yielded rich harvests
          are now sown with a new and terrifying seed — an unrelenting
          crystalline consumption that inches outward from the mill with each
          passing season.'

          The Farmstead and its acres have been severely altered by the
          otherworldly corruption ever since the Comet struck
          the Old Windmill. As if the natural flow of time has been distorted
          beyond recognition; The acres are littered with fossilized remains of
          people, livestock, and petrified crops, as if they have aged
          uncountable years in a blink of an eye. Even the stars above the
          Farmstead are not right; None of the constellations can be seen in
          the sky, and the Northern Star is in the wrong position, as if these
          night skies are not from this time and place.
