          'Welcome home, such as it is. This squalid hamlet, these corrupted
          lands, they are yours now, and you are bound to them.'

          The Hamlet is a quiet, decayed settlement on the Estate's grounds
          where a handful of people still cling to a squalid yet relatively
          civilized existence. Two buildings are dedicated to easing the minds
          of its visitors: the Tavern, where heroes can drink, gamble, or visit
          the brothel, and the Abbey, allowing heroes to meditate, pray, or
          flagellate themselves. At the Blacksmith, weapons and armor can be
          bought for a hefty fee, while the Guild is more than eager to train
          with those that can pay their tuition.

          ─ Old Road Enemies: Brigands

          'Brigands have run of these lanes. Keep to the side-path, the Hamlet
          is just ahead.'

          The Old Road is a poorly-maintained and bandit-plagued road that
          winds through the Weald and connects the Estate to the outside world.
          It is the only in and out of these plagued lands; Travelers often get
          beset by the bandits who made this place their home. New arrivals
          coming by the Stage Coach often suffer accidents because of the
          apparent madness of its drivers.

          ─ Ruins Enemies: Undead, Beasts, Cultists

          'The fiends must be driven back. And what better place to begin than the seat of our noble line?'

          The Ruins are the crumbling remains of the Ancestor's
          estate. All that remains of its former glory is a black, shifting
          maze of corridors firmly under the control of the Necromancers.
          They desecrated the graves of soldiers and nobles alike, bringing
          them back as a mindless skeletal horde. Scattered scraps of faith
          to give comfort to the masses are strew along its shifted corridors
          and sloped vaults. Bookshelves full of old, leather-bound books can
          be found here. The holy altars and fountains seem almost out of
          place against the backdrop of corruption.

          ─ Weald Enemies: Brigands, Fungal, Beasts, Cultists

          'Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life from these
          groves. Let us burn out this evil.'

          The Weald is a stagnant, overgrown forest inhabited by bandits and
          the victims of parasitic fungus. The fruits and victims of this
          spreading corruption are the primary dangers faced when exploring
          here. In addition, the Brigands make their home here, with a powerful
          cannon that protects them from their enemies. Nature herself is a
          victim to this spreading corruption: malformed with misintent. Paths
          and roads bring soldiers and supplies to reduce the isolation of the
          troubled estate.

          ─ Warrens Enemies: Swinefolk, Cultists, Beasts

          'They breed quickly down there in the dark, but perhaps we can
          slay them even faster.'

          The Warrens are an incredibly ancient system of aqueducts and tunnels
          built for an unknown purpose. It is now a corpse-choked cesspit that
          houses the ravenous, disease-ridden beast-men known as the Swinefolk
          and their allies. The ancient walls of the Warrens are beginning to
          crumble, while the tunnels are littered with barrels full of
          foul-smelling liquids and carts filled with human half-eaten human
          remains. The stench of those corpses, mixed with the smell of refuse,
          permeates the air. Always in the background, you can hear the
          constant squealing and screeching of the pig-men that have made this
          place their home.

          ─ Cove Enemies: Pelagic, Drowned

          'These salt-soaked caverns are teeming with pelagic nightmares -
          they must be flushed out!'

          The Cove is a twisted, maze-like cave near the sea. Its eerie tunnels
          house an ancient race of fish-men, called the Pelagic, as well as
          the Drowned - undead sailors cursed to relive he moment of their
          death. The smell of rotten fish is almost unbearable, but despite
          its morbid aspect, this place seems almost traversable. The Ancestor
          once used the Cove as a means to deliver some of his more
          controversial artifacts, as well as a location to perform his pacts
          with the ancient beings in the water when money was scarce. Eerie
          Corals, unholy idols and the remains of destroyed ships adorn these
          sinister tunnels.
