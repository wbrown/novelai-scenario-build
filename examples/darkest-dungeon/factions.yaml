          The Undead are twisted creatures defy the natural order by their
          mere existence, often by being animated (or reanimated) by dark
          forces or by men tampering with supernatural forces. Undead, Wraiths,
          and Ghouls are just a few of the macabre horde of Unholy horrors with
          deep hatred for the Light and all that lives in its loving embrace.

        text: >
          The Fungal represent the twisted corruption by the fungous infection
          spread throughout the Weald; The Fungal Scratchers and Artillery are
          humans and corpses resurrected and controlled by the otherworldly
          spores. They are driven by the sole desire to spread the infective
          mushroom that have taken over their bodies. While the Unclean Giants
          still cling to life, they are often accompanied and controlled by the
          Crones who have taken up residence in the Weald.
      "Faction: Swinefolk":
        keys:
          - Swinefolk

          - Swines
          - Beast-man
          - Beast-men
        text: >
          The Swinefolk are a hybrid-race of beast and men carrying numerous
          diseases. They are the descendants of the Ancestor's experiments, a
          warrior race of pig men whose only desire is to butcher and feed on
          any human they can get their claws on.
      "Facion: Pelagic":
        keys:
          - Pelagic
          - Fish-man
          - Fish-men
        text: >
          The Pelagic are a race of ancient fishmen that live in the cove.
          They were roused by the activity around their home, making it a habit
          to sink and kill any sailors that come near their domain. They pose a
          great threat to the marine shipments of provisions that the Hamlet
          relies on.
      "Faction: Drowned":
        keys:
          - Drowned
          - Sailors
          - Zombies
        text: >
          The Drowned were once a a crew of particularly unsavory mariners,
          who sailed the four corners at the Ancestor's behest. When they
          increased their tariffs, he prepared an alternative payment. The
          Ancestor hexed their anchor with every twisted incantation he could
          muster and dragged craft and crew to the swirling depth. But it was
          not their end; They managed to return to the surface - a Ghost Ship
          seeking vengeance.
      "Faction: Brigands":
        keys:
          - Brigand
          - Bandit
          - Brigands
          - Bandits
        text: >
          The Brigands are hardened bandits and killers that the Ancestor hired
          as a mercenary army to retake the Hamlet after the people rebelled
          against him. Once the Ancestor died and no further payment seemed in
          sight, those same mercenaries turned to banditry, and they can be
          found raiding any of the areas surrounding the Hamlet. Expect no
          quarter from them, and offer none.
      "Faction: Cultists":
        keys:
          - Cultist
          - Cultists
        text: >
          The Cultists of these lands worship an Eldritch god. Revelation of
          the crawling chaos and the entity slumbering below has a rather
          curious effect on the minds of men. However, a few individuals
          revel in these revelations, and are driven to fanatical devotion.
          These Cultists have flocked to the Estate to worship the nascent
          god and have completely given themselves over to it in mind, body
          and soul. They are ready, willing and eager to lay down their lives
          to protect it from anyone.
      "Faction: Beasts":

        text: >
          The Beasts encompasses all of the savage animals that have been
          tainted by the spreading darkness or awakened by those who trespass
          into their ancient domain.
