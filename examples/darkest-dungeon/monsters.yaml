          Bone Rabbles are the weakest kind of skeletal enemies you may
          encounter. Barely held together by the Necromancer's magic, their
          main purpose is to use their bodies to protect their allies.

          A Bone Rabble mainly uses Bump in the Night, where it clobbers its
          target with a makeshift club. It uses Tic-Toc to close the gap, if
          pushed back.

          Bone Soldiers are the common footsoldiers of the Undead. These
          skeletal warriors are sufficiently equipped to hit hard and last some
          time on the battlefield. Still, The Bone Soldiers remain relatively
          weak and are easily dispatched.

          The Bone Soldier mainly uses Graveyard Slash, a skilled strike with
          its rusted, but deadly, blade. It attempts to use Graveyard Stumble
          wto get in reach for its weapon.

          with the Ancestor or his family. This skeletal royalty act deceivers
          and advisors to the Necromancer's of the ruins.

          The Bone Courtier mainly uses its signature Tempting Goblet to
          disturb even the most hardened adventurer. It also uses Knife in The
          Dark to stab with its dagger at a nearby target.

          Bone Captains are tough, hulking skeletal leaders, clad in heavy armor
          and wielding a mace. In life they stood as veterans of war and in death
          they play largely the same role.

          A Bone Captain primarily uses Ground Pound, a mighty smash that will
          shake the very foundation beneath your feet. It also may perform a
          Crushing Blow, leaving their target disoriented from the heavy impact.

          safety of the back ranks, and end up in an awkward position if drawn to
          the front.

          The Bone Arbalist primarily uses its Quarrel ability, shooting from the
          back line with deadly precision. It uses Bayonet Jab to retreat to the
          back, should it find itself face-to-face with an enemy.

          Fungal Scratchers were most likely lost travelers, that didn't get consumed
          by the Hag. These zombies can take a surprising amount of punishment, while
          their claws secrete a poison that burns the flesh of their victims.

          A Fungal Scratcher uses mainly Rend the Marked against Marked targets,
          otherwise it strikes simply with Groping Swipe. It uses Harmless Swipe
          against targets out of normal reach.

          as their counterpart - the Fungal Scratchers - the Fungal Artilleries possess more
          potent poisons and carries the ability to mark their targets.

          A Fungal Artillery will primarily use its Rain of Blight to inflict its target with
          stinging poison. Furthermore, it can use Mark Prey to provide its allies an opening
          on their enemies. Should it be drawn into close-combat, the Fungal Artillery will use
          a poisonous Escape Cloud to retreat to safety.

          Unclean Giants are perhaps the oddest creature in the Weald. Their origin may be
          unclear, but these lumbering monstrosities wield uprooted tree trunks like maces
          and are capable of using the fungous growth on their back to spread confusion among
          their enemies.

          An Unclean Giant uses its Treebranch Smackdown to inflict devastating wounds upon its
          target, knocking it back in the process. It will sometimes use either Confusion Spores
          or Poison Spores to affect enemies, who try to stay out of reach.

          The Swine Choppers are large, brutish hybrids of man and pig. They are the healthier
          specimens of Swinefolk. The Swine Choppers will happily test their bloody, serrated cleavers
          upon the bodies of naive adventurers who might happen upon their squalid homes. Slow and
          hulking, the Choppers also wield heavy balls and chains to extend their range with
          head-ringing efficiency.

          A Swine Chopper often uses its cleaver for a Butcher Cut, inflicting deep bleeding
          wounds upon its target. Should this not suffice, the Swine Chopper uses Ball and Chain
          to send anyone reeling from the impact.

          a body that has been twisted and contorted to an unfathomable design - a mangled amalgamation
          of flesh that embodies the perverse crime against nature that created the Swinefolk. Always
          screaming and squealing through the darkened corridors of its squalid home.

          The Swine Wretch poses no direct threat, but its Vomit is rampant with disease and
          sickness and will inflict those upon its target.

          pounding on the drums as loudly as possible, thus coordinating their allies by Marking
          targets to attack, but sometimes the sound of their drums alone, echoing in the enclosed
          spaces of the Warrens, is enough to throw a person into despair.

          A Swine Drummer either uses Drum of Debilitation to Mark an enemy or Drum of Doom to
          drive it towards madness.

          immense threat with their hook, they use to slash their prey.

          A Swine Slasher's sole attack is Hook Where It Hurts. It uses its vicious hook to inflict
          deep lacerations upon its target, while simutanously retreating to the back lines,
          from where it still can attack.

          bitten humans into their kind and filling out their ranks.

          almost negligible protection, they have immense offensive capabilities.

          The Brigand Cutthroat will usually start by weakening their opposition using
          Slice And Dice attacks, before exploiting it with Shank. The Brigand Cutthroat
          will use Uppercut Slice to push enemies back, should he feel threatened enough.
          Finally, if he can't find a good opening for an attack, he will use Harmless
          Poke in an attempt to close to gap to his target.

          their blades and whips. Be wary and do not underestimate this opponent.

          The Brigand Fusilier is incredibily nimble and often the first one to act. He
          uses Blanket Fire at every opportunity he gets. If the Fusilier finds himself
          face to face with an opponent, he will use Rushed Shot to retreat to the safety
