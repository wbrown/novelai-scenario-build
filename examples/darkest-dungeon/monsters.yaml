          Bone Rabbles are the weakest kind of skeletal enemies you may
          encounter. Barely held together by the Necromancer's magic, their
          main purpose is to use their bodies to protect their allies.

          A Bone Rabble uses Bump in the Night, where it clobbers its
          target with a makeshift club. It uses Tic-Toc to close the gap, if
          pushed back.

          Bone Soldiers are the common foot soldiers of the Undead. These
          skeletal warriors are sufficiently equipped to hit hard and last some
          time on the battlefield. The Bone Soldiers still remain relatively
          weak and are easily dispatched.

          A Bone Soldier uses Graveyard Slash - a skilled strike with
          its rusted, but deadly, blade. It uses Graveyard Stumble to get in
          reach for its weapon.

          A Bone Courtier uses its signature Tempting Goblet to

          A Bone Captain uses Ground Pound - a mighty smash that will

          punishment, while their claws secrete a poison that burns the flesh
          of their victims.

        text: >
          Brigand Cutthroats are masterfully skilled with their blades, and able to
          deliver deadly thrusts that can easily decimate even the toughest of
          adventuring parties. While the Brigand Cutthroats may look fragile with
          almost negligible protection, they have immense offensive capabilities.

          A Brigand Cutthroat will usually start by weakening their opposition using
          Slice And Dice attacks, before exploiting it with Shank. The Brigand Cutthroat
          will use Uppercut Slice to push enemies back, should he feel threatened enough.
          Finally, if he can't find a good opening for an attack, he will use Harmless
          Poke in an attempt to close to gap to his target.
