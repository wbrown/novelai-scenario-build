Template - Preamble:
Location: The Old Road, Beginning of Corridor
You are Dismas, a male Highwayman, and you ponder the nature of your profession and how you might best support your companion, Reynauld who is a Crusader.
You encounter a Brigand Cutthroat! He is hooded, and wields a pair of daggers with expert skill. Reynauld steps forward in front of you. "You should leave this place, stranger. This is no safe haven for you."
The brigand's eyes gleam under his cowl as he smirks. "Hah! You're new here, aren't you? I'm surprised you've got the nerve to speak to me like that, even if you are a pretty little thing."
Your heart beats faster. The dagger in his hand glints with reflected light.
> You lunge for the Brigand and make a Wicked Slice with your own blade.
─ Your Wicked Slice lands on the Brigand Cutthroat with a critical hit.
The brigand cries out and falls back, clutching at his chest. Blood seeps between his fingers and he grunts, "Aaaargh!"
> You yell "Now, Reynauld! Dispatch him with your Holy Smite!"
- Reynauld's Holy Smite incinerates the Brigand Cutthroat with holy fire!
Reynauld raises his hands and a blinding flash of white light envelops the brigand. His flesh boils and splits. A putrid smell rises from the corpse.
"Aaaaaagh!"
The brigand roars and staggers back, dropping one of his knives. The other clatters to the ground. The brigand's eyes roll back into his head and he collapses to the ground.
> You say "Well done, Reynauld, let's see what curio or treasure he has."
Reynauld kneels beside the body. He pulls off the brigand's cloak and then removes the brigand's belt.
As he lifts the brigand's arms, a silver ring glimmers on his finger.
> You ask "Ah, what is that?"
"It's a signet ring," Reynauld replies. "They used to wear them as badges of office. If you have a special ability, you'd mark it with a symbol."
"That must be a powerful item, then. What does it do?"
"I don't know. But I'll keep it for now."
Reynauld pockets the ring and stands up. He looks around, and then nods. "Let's move on."
> You move on.
Location: The Old Road, End of Corridor
You move on with Reynauld, and find a portal deeper into the woods. Stepping in, you are surprised by a Brigand Bloodletter, and a Brigand Fusilier! They stand guard over a large strongbox.

***
Faction - Undead:
The Undead are twisted creatures defy the natural order by their mere existence, often by being animated (or reanimated) by dark forces or by men tampering with supernatural forces. Undead, Wraiths, and Ghouls are just a few of the macabre horde of Unholy horrors with deep hatred for the Light and all that lives in its loving embrace.
***
Faction - Fungal:
The Fungal represent the twisted corruption by the fungous infection spread throughout the Weald; The Fungal Scratchers and Artillery are humans and corpses resurrected and controlled by the otherworldly spores. They are driven by the sole desire to spread the infective mushroom that have taken over their bodies. While the Unclean Giants still cling to life, they are often accompanied and controlled by the Crones who have taken up residence in the Weald.
***
Faction - Swinefolk:
The Swinefolk are a hybrid-race of beast and men carrying numerous diseases. They are the descendants of the Ancestor's experiments, a warrior race of pig men whose only desire is to butcher and feed on any human they can get their claws on.
***
Faction - Pelagic:
The Pelagic are a race of ancient fishmen that live in the cove. They were roused by the activity around their home, making it a habit to sink and kill any sailors that come near their domain. They pose a great threat to the marine shipments of provisions that the Hamlet relies on.
***
Faction - Drowned:
The Drowned were once a a crew of particularly unsavory mariners, who sailed the four corners at the Ancestor's behest. When they increased their tariffs, he prepared an alternative payment.

But it was not their end; They managed to return to the surface - a Ghost Ship seeking vengeance.
***
Faction - Brigands:
The Brigands are hardened bandits and killers that the Ancestor hired as a mercenary army to retake the Hamlet after the people rebelled against him. Once the Ancestor died and no further payment seemed in sight, those same mercenaries turned to banditry, and they can be found raiding any of the areas surrounding the Hamlet. Expect no quarter from them, and offer none.
***
Faction - Cultists:
The Cultists of these lands worship an Eldritch god. Revelation of the crawling chaos and the entity slumbering below has a rather curious effect on the minds of men. However, a few individuals revel in these revelations, and are driven to fanatical devotion. These Cultists have flocked to the Estate to worship the nascent god and have completely given themselves over to it in mind, body and soul. They are ready, willing and eager to lay down their lives to protect it from anyone.

Dungeon - the Weald:
'Corruption has soaked the soil, sapping all good life from these groves. Let us burn out this evil.'
The Weald is a stagnant, overgrown forest inhabited by bandits and the victims of parasitic fungus. The fruits and victims of this spreading corruption are the primary dangers faced when exploring here. In addition, the Brigands make their home in the Weald, backed by a powerful cannon that protects them from their enemies. The trees are misshaping and covered in the fungous infection spread by the local witches. The smell of rotting carcasses and the sound of rabid wolves howling fills the air.
***
Dungeon - the Warrens:
'They breed quickly down there in the dark, but perhaps we can slay them even faster.'
The Warrens are an incredibly ancient system of aqueducts and tunnels built for an unknown purpose. It is a corpse- choked cesspit that houses the ravenous, disease-ridden beast-men known as the Swinefolk and their allies. The ancient walls of the Warrens are beginning to crumble, while the tunnels are littered with barrels full of foul-smelling liquids and carts filled with human half-eaten human remains. The stench of those corpses, mixed with the smell of refuse, permeates the air. Always in the background, you can hear the constant squealing and screeching of the pig-men. 
***

Eerie shimmering corals provide the only natural light around here, while unholy idols and the remains of destroyed ships lay scattered on the stony cave-floor.

The Hamlet is a quiet, decayed settlement on the Estate's grounds where a handful of people still cling to a squalid yet relatively civilized existence. Two buildings are dedicated to easing the minds of its visitors: the Tavern, where heroes can drink, gamble, or visit the brothel, and the Abbey, allowing heroes to meditate, pray, or flagellate themselves. At the Blacksmith, weapons and armor can be bought for a hefty fee, while the Guild is more than eager to train with those that can pay their tuition.
***
Dungeon - the Old Road:
'Brigands have run of these lanes. Keep to the side-path, the Hamlet is just ahead.'

Dungeon - the Ruins:
'The fiends must be driven back. And what better place to begin than the seat of our noble line?'
The Ruins are the crumbling remains of the Ancestor's estate. All that remains of its former glory is a black, shifting maze of corridors; Firmly under the control of the Necromancers. The walls of the Ruins are adorned with the fading emblems of the Ancestor and bookshelves full of old, leather-bound books. The cold air is filled with the stale smell of dust and abandonment. You can hear a faint chanting in the background, just gnawing at the edge of your mind.
