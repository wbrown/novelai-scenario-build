      "Class: male Abomination":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Abomination/
        text: >
          The Abomination has been beaten, branded and imprisoned for untold
          decades. The Eldritch poison coursing through his veins has given him
          unspeakable power, at a terrible cost. His progressive mutation
          manifests in unspeakable strength, speed, and a profusion of bile.

          During combat, the Abomination is protected by cursed chains and a
          thick, leathery hide. He can withstand the pressures of frontline
          combat as well as any plated footman. Manacles stuns the target with
          a whack from the heavy chains wrapped around the Abomination's
          wrists. Beast's Bile inflicts the target with poisonous blight.
          Transform unleashes the Abomination's inner monstrosity, healing
          him and supplying him with claws as large as daggers as long as he
          remains transformed. Rake is a vicious melee attack, which starts out
          weak but ramps up in damage for each use. Slam is a charge attack,
          often leaving the target reeling.
      "Class: male Antiquarian":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Antiquarian/
        text: >
          The Antiquarian is a scholar, researcher, and a keen archaeologist.
          While the Antiquarian is a liability in combat, he makes up for it
          with his keen ability to detect treasure and the vast knowledge he
          brings about the various trinkets and charms that can be found in
          these doomed lands.

          During combat, the Antiquarian makes himself scarce to ensure his
          own survival. Nervous Stab is a meek attack with his kukri. Festering
          Vapors emits noxious gas from the Antiquarian's censer to inflict
          middling Blight. Flashpowder reduces a single enemy's accuracy. Get
          Down brings the Antiquarian out of harms reach. Protect Me forces an
          ally to guard him, while giving them an excellent defensive boost in
          return.
      "Class: male Arbalest":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Arbalest/
        text: >
          The Arbalest is a runaway turned soldier clad in heavy armor and able
          to vanquish foes with his massive crossbow. His life of war has given
          him many skills for the battlefield, and his heavy crossbow allows
          him to snipe high-priority targets from afar. At camp, the Arbalest
          often spends his night tending to his crossbow - his one companion
          since childhood. As long as he is given ample distance between
          himself and his quarry, no foe is safe from this sharpshooter's
          wrath.

          During combat, the Arbalest will stay behind his allies and harass
          the enemies with well-placed shots from his giant crossbow. Sniper
          Shot is an incredibly skilled shot, able to hit any target from
          anywhere. Battlefield Bandage heal a target of its most grievous
          wounds. Bola hinders the Arbalest's target from movement. Suppressing
          Fire wreaks havoc on entire enemy parties.
      "Class: male Bounty Hunter":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Bounty Hunter/
        text: >
          The Bounty Hunter is a brutally efficient hunter. For him, planning
          is key - He has found that simply striking before thinking is an
          ineffective way to kill, so he has taught himself many ways to take
          advantage of his foe's vulnerabilities. At camp, like in combat, the
          Bounty Hunter is all about preparedness. He can take time to study
          his notes, bettering his odds against his foes.

          During combat, the Bounty Hunter specializes in targeting a single
          foe to deliver its head for the reward. Mark for Death finds weak
          spots in his enemies' armor. Collect Bounty capitalizes on any
          opening found and delivers a devastating hit with the Bounty Hunter's
          axe. Come Hither pulls the target in or slice them up with his sharp
          grappling hook. Flashbang disorients the target, leaving them blinded
          for a moment. No matter the situation, this calculating killer will
          have an answer for it.
      "Class: male Crusader":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Crusader/
        text: >
          The Crusader is a champion - a hero to rally otherwise common men to
          a righteous cause. With holy blade in hand, he smites the wicked and
          sends them back to the darkness from whence they crept. No matter
          the pressures he faces, he will remain strong, finding strength
          within himself to keep fighting on while inspiring others to do the
          same.

          During combat, The Crusader is restricted in movement, due to his
          heavy armor. Though, thanks to its great protection, he can stand
          in the frontline to take the blows that his weaker comrades cannot.
          Smite is a strike with the Crusader's great sword and especially
          effective against the Undead. Holy Lance is a charge attack, able
          to hit even the furthest enemies. Bulwark of Faith will ensure that
          most enemy damage thrown then Crusader's way does barely a scratch
          on him. Inspiring Cry keeps the front line from collapsing, the
          fearful from snapping, and the darkness from taking hold.
      "Class: male Flagellant":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Flagellant/
        text: >
          The Flagellant relishes the scars and abrasions that cover his body
          - drawing incomprehensible resilience from the tearing of his own
          flesh. His flail, a particularly cruel and merciless weapon, drips
          with his enemies' blood and his own.

          During combat, the Flagellant stands like a wall between his comrades
          and his foes, with his arms wide open, his body exposed, acting like
          a magnet for all harm that may come their way. Punish is a merciless
          strike with his flail - inflicting the target with bleeding wounds.
          Reclaim heals an ally while opening the Flagellants own wounds in
          return. The Flagellant's abilities are respectable on their own, but
          they only become more powerful as his body and mind are abused to
          their limit. Exsanguinate renders immense punishment against the
          Flagellant's foes. Redeem restores his body as well as that of an
          ally.
      "Class: male Grave Robber":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Grave Robber/
        text: >
          The Grave Robber was born into money, and married into more. But
          when his spouse's boorish lust and drunken temper became too much
          to bear, he had to act. Years of decadence and financial
          mismanagement had left his estate in staggering debt. To preserve
          his social standing, he pilfered his late spouse's tomb, but found
          the thrill too exhilarating to ever return to his old life and
          instead took on the life of a restless wanderer.

          During combat, the Grave Robber is an incredibly nimble fighter,
          evading hits that would easily bring him to Death's Door. Pick to
          the Face is a melee attack with the Grave Robber's trusty pickaxe.
          Lunge is a charge attack with his dagger. Shadow Fade allows him to
          retreat to the back lines, giving him stealth and a boost in offense.
          Throw Daggers is a skilled ranged attack. Poison Darts inflicts the
          target with noxious blight.
      "Class: male Hellion":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Hellion/
        text: >
          The Hellion is wild, unpredictable, and utterly ruthless; He thrills
          to the spilling of blood! His massive glaive affords him impressive
          reach in combat, while its razor sharp edge leaves lasting wounds on
          enemies. Versatile and unrelenting, he can hit the back row with his
          blade and devastate his foes. His versatility is only matched by his
          ferocity.

          During combat, the Hellion will face any enemy head-on and can pick
          on even the furthest enemies thanks to his giant glaive. Breakthrough
          is a wide swing against multiple enemies. Bleed Out maims the target
          and inflicts them with deep bleeding wounds. These abilities leave
          the Hellion exhausted, reducing his effectiveness in long battles,
          and are crippling to him when overused. Iron Swan is an exquisite
          option to pick off enemies far in the back. Adrenaline Rush buffs up
          the Hellion's damage to help counter him exhaustion.
      "Class: male Highwayman":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Highwayman/
        text: >
          The Highwayman is a bandit seeking redemption. When night falls, the
          Highwayman relishes cynical preparedness and off-color jokes around
          the campfire. A life spent running and hiding has taught him the
          tenuous benefit of perimeter alarms, and late-night investigations
          into the encroaching shadows.

          During combat, the Highwayman shows unparalleled finesse and
          ferocity. Pistol Shot picks off foes from afar. Duelist's Advance
          moves the Highwayman forward with and sets up a Riposte, retaliating
          attacks made against him. Wicked Slice is a melee attack with his
          dirk. Grapeshot Blast is a devastating attack against multiple
          enemies, finishing off weakened enemies and softening up others.
          Point Blank Shot is a close-combat shot, used to inflict massive
          damage against the Highwayman's foe.
      "Class: male Houndmaster":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Houndmaster/
        text: >
          The Houndmaster is a tough and uncommonly compassionate ex-lawman.
          He and his faithful Wolfhound work in tandem to bring down their
          enemies and protect the innocent. Still clad in his worn Gendarme's
          uniform, the Houndmaster's focus is on evasion over mitigation. His
          cudgel is an effective, stunning tool, but it is the Hound who
          delivers the pair's most crippling blows.

          During combat, the Houndmaster relies on his faithful dog and will
          put himself into harms way to protect his trusty companion. Hound's
          Rush sends forth Wolfhound against one target. Target Whistle reveals
          weak spots in the foe's defense. Cry Havoc puts the mind of the
          Houndmaster's allies at ease. Guard Dog protects an ally and raises
          the dog's defensive abilities. Lick Wounds provides a quick self-heal
          in a pinch. Blackjack stuns enemies with a heavy wack of the cudgel.
      "Class: male Jester":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Jester/
        text: >
          The Jester brings a good laugh, a merry song, and a razor sharp blade
          into the darkest depths of these twisted lands. Clad only in mildewed
          cloth, the Jester makes a mockery of battle. As an entertainer, he
          can turn a stressful night of camping into a night of merriment and
          wit. For the Jester, combat is a power ballad - a slow build up, and
          a grand finale!

          During combat, the Jester easily moves through enemy lines, often
          relying both on luck and skill. Slice Off is a skillful attack with
          the Jester's sickle, leaving his enemies bleeding. Dirk Stab, moves
          the Jester to the front of combat. Finale deals extraordinary damage
          to one enemy. This leaves the Jester open to any retaliation should
          it not finish his enemy off. Inspiring Tune is a unique support
          ability; The Jester can perform by playing a tune on his lute to put
          anyone's mind at ease.
      "Class: male Leper":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Leper/
        text: >
          The Leper is a ruined man, a warrior and a poet. Struggle, and
          futility — all one's days are a constant toil to shelter life's
          ember through one more night. The Leper not only knows but embraces
          such solemnity. Tortured existence has taught him to count not on
          the care of others. The Leper can gain strength others can but
          dream of, or the endurance to bear what no other could. And when
          his massive blade falls, death's call rings loud to all caught
          in its thunderous arc. However, such force falls not nimbly, and
          foes may lightly evade their execution.

          During Combat, the Leper will face any opposition head on. Chop
          is a devastating strike with his execution's blade against a close
          target. Intimidate shakes the target's resolve. Purge knocks back
          an enemy back. Withstand gives the Leper increased resistances.
      "Class: male Man-at-Arms":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Man-at-Arms/
        text: >
          The Man-at-Arms is an old, battle-scarred veteran, who has seen
          enough war and bloodshed to last more than a dozen lifetimes. While
          he can no longer swing his great mace with the force he once could,
          no one should stand where he swings his mighty weapon. The
          Man-at-Arms is a seasoned veteran, and has been rewarded for his
          toil with haunting guilt and stoic resilience. The Man-at-Arms
          breaks down enemy lines with his mace, shield, and furious battle
          cries.

          During combat, the Man-at-Arms protects his allies with Defender,
          redirecting an attack towards him. Bellow shakes the enemies resolve,
          giving your team the upper hand in combat. Rampart knocks back and
          stun an enemy, while moving the Man-at-Arms into close combat.
          Retribution activates Riposte, countering any attacks attempted at
          him with a solid smack of his shield.
      "Class: male Musketeer":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Musketeer/
        text: >
          The Musketeer is a competitive sharpshooter with little practical
          experience, and excels when enemies remain at a distance. Although
          outwardly inconspicuous, the Musketeer's regalia is reinforced with
          hardened leather under armor, allowing him to sustain a considerable
          amount of punishment. His musket's variable ammunition and trusty
          sidearm allow him to deal debilitating damage at range.

          During combat, the Musketeer stays in the far back, relying on his
          immaculate aim. Aimed Shot is a well-placed shot against enemies in
          the back. Smokescreen blind the target. Buckshot knocks its target
          back. Sidearm buys the Musketeer time to retreat to the safety of
          the back line.
      "Class: male Occultist":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Occultist/
        text: >
          The Occultist is living proof that the dark arts can be used to
          expunge darkness itself. He has utilized that same knowledge as the
          Ancestor to further his understanding of the eldritch. His pursuits
          have left his body fragile and weak, but it has made his mind sharp
          and his capabilities most versatile. In his younger years, the
          Occultist clashed with the Shambler and harness a portion of its
          power.

          During combat, the Occultist calls upon the dark arts to serve him.
          Daemon's Pull wrenches individuals to the front of the fray.
          Sacrificial Stab is a melee attack that is especially effective
          against Eldritch horrors. Abyssal Artillery calls forth otherworldly
          tentacles to harass and harm groups of enemies. Wyrd Reconstruction
          reconstructs flesh and heal wounds. This technique is powerful, but
          unpredictable, as it may restore his ally to perfect health or tear
          apart their flesh.
      "Class: male Plague Doctor":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Plague Doctor/
        text: >
          The Plague Doctor is brilliant and bold; His unconventional theories
          created nothing short of a scandal during his education. The
          mysteries of the human body - of life and death itself - had always
          fascinated him. When his research was at a critical point, a grim
          opportunity to prove his theories presented himself. In the weeks
          that followed, however, he found himself unable to focus, instead
          sitting motionless at his desk, paralyzed by the ceaseless wailing
          that reverberated in his mind. The Plague Doctor makes use of
          experimental remedies and risky healing practices to cure his
          companions' ailments, and restore their vigor.

          During combat, the Plague Doctor stays far in the back, throwing
          his various concoctions at his enemies. Plague Grenade inflicts
          his enemies with noxious blight. Blinding Gas is a powerful stun.
          Battlefield Medicine  cures both the Plague Doctor and allies of
          any ailments. Incision is a melee attack, that inflicts bleeding
          wounds on the target.
      "Class: male Shieldbreaker":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Shieldbreaker/
        text: >
          The Shieldbreaker hails from the distant windswept dunes of the east.
          Deadly as a viper, his iron will has been forged in the heat of the
          blazing desert sun. Though outwardly demure, his emancipation from
          the barren wastes came at a price so terrible, it haunts his dreams
          even now... An unfortunate series of events forced the Shieldbreaker
          to cut his hand to survive, and the images of the past haunt him
          until today.

          During combat, the Shieldbreaker gracefully moves about the
          battlefield, wielding a spear and buckler to keep himself out of
          danger while he swiftly decimates the enemy defenses. His dancer's
          garb is better suited to the stage than the dungeon; he must be
          quick to survive. Pierce entirely ignores armor. Captivate pulls
          enemies to the front. Adder's Kiss is a devastating attack, that
          infects the target with blight. Serpent Sway raises the
          Shieldbreaker's defensive abilities and often gets him out of
          harms way.
      "Class: male Vestal":
        keys:
          - /accompanied by [a-zA-Z]+, a male Vestal/
        text: >
          The Vestal is a brother of battle; Pious and unrelenting, he is
          determined to bring faith on the battlefield as a weapon against
          corruption. Prayers, chants, and blessings bring peace and solace
          to the Vestal and his party at night, heal the wounded and protect
          from nighttime attacks. Blessed plate mail encases the Vestal as
          he delivers terrible violence and healing comfort in equal measure.
          
          During combat, the Vestal wields a mace in one hand, and a holy
          book in the other. This warrior monk often channels his zeal for
          battle into healing abilities. Divine Grace heals the target of
          its most grievous injuries. Holy Judgement calls upon the light
          itself to strike against the Vestal's foes. Mace Bash is a strong
          melee attack. Dazzling Light blinds the target with the Vestal's
          divine powers.
