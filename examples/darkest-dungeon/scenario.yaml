  "There is a place, beneath those ancient ruins, in the moor, that calls out
  to the boldest among them... 'We are the Flame!' they cry, 'And Darkness
  fears us!' They descend, spurred on by fantasies of riches and redemption, to
  lay bare whatever blasphemous abnormality may slumber restlessly in that
  unholy abyss... But Darkness is insidious. Terror and Madness can find cracks
  in the sturdiest of armors, the most resolute of minds... And below, in that
  limitless chasm of Chaos, they will realize the truth of it. 'We are not the
  Flame!' they will cry out, 'We are but moths, and we are DOOMED!' And their
  screams will echo amidst the pitiless cyclopean stones... Of the Darkest
  Dungeon.
  
  Ruin has come to our family. You remember our venerable house, opulent and
  imperial. Gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the moor. I lived all my
  years in that ancient, rumor-shadowed manor. Fattened by decadence and
  luxury. And yet, I began to tire of conventional extravagance. Singular,
  unsettling tales suggested the mansion itself was a gateway to some fabulous
  and unnameable power. With relic and ritual, I bent every effort towards the
  excavation and recovery of those long-buried secrets, exhausting what
  remained of our family fortune on swarthy workmen and sturdy shovels. At
  last, in the salt-soaked crags beneath the lowest foundations, we unearthed
  that damnable portal of antediluvian evil. Our every step unsettled the
  ancient earth, but we were in a realm of death and madness! In the end, I
  alone fled, laughing and wailing through those blackened arcades of antiquity.
  Until consciousness failed me. You remember our venerable house, opulent and
  imperial. It is a festering monstrosity! I beg you, return home, claim your
  birthright, and deliver our family from the ravenous clutching shadows of the
  Darkest Dungeon."
