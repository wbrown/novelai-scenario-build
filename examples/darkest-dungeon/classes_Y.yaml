          vanquish foes with your massive crossbow. Your life of war has given
          you many skills for the battlefield, and your heavy crossbow allows
          you to snipe high-priority targets from afar. At camp, you often
          spends your night tending to your crossbow - your one companion since

          and your quarry, no foe is safe from this sharpshooter's wrath.

          You are a brutally efficient hunter. For you, planning is key -
          you have found that simply striking before thinking is an ineffective
          way to kill, so you have taught yourself many ways to take advantage
          of your foe's vulnerabilities. At camp, like in combat, you are all
          about preparedness. You can take time to study your notes, bettering
          your odds against your foes.

          righteous cause. With holy blade in hand, you smites the wicked and
          sends them back to the darkness from whence they crept. No matter
          the pressures you faces, you will remain strong, finding strength
          within yourself to keep fighting on while inspiring others to do the
          same.

          During combat, you are restricted in movement, due to your heavy
          armor. Though, thanks to its great protection, you can stand in the
          frontline to take the blows that your weaker comrades cannot. Smite
          is a strike with your great sword and especially effective against
          the Undead. Holy Lance is a charge attack, able to hit even the
          furthest enemies. Bulwark of Faith will ensure that most enemy

          your foes, with your arms wide open, your body exposed, acting like
          a magnet for all harm that may come your way. Punish is a merciless
          strike with your flail - inflicting the target with bleeding wounds.
          Reclaim heals an ally while opening your own wounds in return. Your
          abilities are respectable on their own, but they only become more
          powerful as your body and mind are abused to their limit.

          left your estate in staggering debt. To preserve your social
          standing, you pilfered your late spouse's tomb, but found the thrill
