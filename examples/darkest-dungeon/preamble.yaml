          - clutching shadows of the Darkest Dungeon
        text: >
          Location: The Old Road, Beginning of Corridor

          You are Dismas, a male Highwayman, and you ponder the nature of your
          profession and how you might best support your companion,
          Reynauld who is a Crusader.

          You encounter a Brigand Cutthroat! He is hooded, and wields a pair of
          daggers with expert skill.
          Reynauld steps forward in front of you. "You should leave this place,
          stranger. This is no safe haven for you."

          The brigand's eyes gleam under his cowl as he smirks. "Hah! You're
          new here, aren't you? I'm surprised you've got the nerve to speak to
          me like that, even if you are a pretty little thing."

          Your heart beats faster. The dagger in his hand glints with reflected
          light.

          > You lunge for the Brigand and make a Wicked Slice with your own
          blade.

          â”€ Your Wicked Slice lands on the Brigand Cutthroat with a critical
          hit.

          The brigand cries out and falls back, clutching at his chest. Blood
          seeps between his fingers and he grunts, "Aaaargh!"

          > You yell "Now, Reynauld! Dispatch him with your Holy Smite!"

          - Reynauld's Holy Smite incinerates the Brigand Cutthroat with holy
          fire!

          Reynauld raises his hands and a blinding flash of white light
          envelops the brigand. His flesh boils and splits. A putrid smell
          rises from the corpse.

          "Aaaaaagh!"

          The brigand roars and staggers back, dropping one of his knives. The
          other clatters to the ground. The brigand's eyes roll back into his
          head and he collapses to the ground.

          > You say "Well done, Reynauld, let's see what curio or treasure he
          has."

          Reynauld kneels beside the body. He pulls off the brigand's cloak
          and then removes the brigand's belt.

          As he lifts the brigand's arms, a silver ring glimmers on his finger.

          > You ask "Ah, what is that?"

          "It's a signet ring," Reynauld replies. "They used to wear them as
          badges of office. If you have a special ability, you'd mark it with a
          symbol."

          "That must be a powerful item, then. What does it do?"

          "I don't know. But I'll keep it for now."

          Reynauld pockets the ring and stands up. He looks around, and then
          nods. "Let's move on."

          > You move on.

          Location: The Old Road, End of Corridor

          You move on with Reynauld, and find a portal deeper into the woods.
          Stepping in, you are surprised by a Brigand Bloodletter, and a
          Brigand Fusilier! They stand guard over a large strongbox.
