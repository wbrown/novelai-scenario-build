   "text": "Location: The Old Road, Beginning of Corridor\nYou are Dismas, a male Highwayman, and you ponder the nature of your profession and how you might best support your companion, Reynauld who is a Crusader.\nYou encounter a Brigand Cutthroat! He is hooded, and wields a pair of daggers with expert skill. Reynauld steps forward in front of you. \"You should leave this place, stranger. This is no safe haven for you.\"\nThe brigand's eyes gleam under his cowl as he smirks. \"Hah! You're new here, aren't you? I'm surprised you've got the nerve to speak to me like that, even if you are a pretty little thing.\"\nYour heart beats faster. The dagger in his hand glints with reflected light.\n\u003e You lunge for the Brigand and make a Wicked Slice with your own blade.\nâ”€ Your Wicked Slice lands on the Brigand Cutthroat with a critical hit.\nThe brigand cries out and falls back, clutching at his chest. Blood seeps between his fingers and he grunts, \"Aaaargh!\"\n\u003e You yell \"Now, Reynauld! Dispatch him with your Holy Smite!\"\n- Reynauld's Holy Smite incinerates the Brigand Cutthroat with holy fire!\nReynauld raises his hands and a blinding flash of white light envelops the brigand. His flesh boils and splits. A putrid smell rises from the corpse.\n\"Aaaaaagh!\"\nThe brigand roars and staggers back, dropping one of his knives. The other clatters to the ground. The brigand's eyes roll back into his head and he collapses to the ground.\n\u003e You say \"Well done, Reynauld, let's see what curio or treasure he has.\"\nReynauld kneels beside the body. He pulls off the brigand's cloak and then removes the brigand's belt.\nAs he lifts the brigand's arms, a silver ring glimmers on his finger.\n\u003e You ask \"Ah, what is that?\"\n\"It's a signet ring,\" Reynauld replies. \"They used to wear them as badges of office. If you have a special ability, you'd mark it with a symbol.\"\n\"That must be a powerful item, then. What does it do?\"\n\"I don't know. But I'll keep it for now.\"\nReynauld pockets the ring and stands up. He looks around, and then nods. \"Let's move on.\"\n\u003e You move on.\nLocation: The Old Road, End of Corridor\nYou move on with Reynauld, and find a portal deeper into the woods. Stepping in, you are surprised by a Brigand Bloodletter, and a Brigand Fusilier! They stand guard over a large strongbox.",
