          Location: The Old Road, Beginning of Corridor

          "Brigands have run of these lanes. Keep to the side path; the Hamlet is just ahead."

          You encounter a Brigand Cutthroat! He is hooded, and wields a pair of daggers with expert skill.
          Reynauld steps forward in front of you. "You should leave this place, stranger. This is no safe haven for you."

          The brigand's eyes gleam under his cowl as he smirks. "Hah! You're new here, aren't you?
          I'm surprised you've got the nerve to speak to me like that, even if you are a pretty little thing."

          Your heart beats faster. The dagger in his hand glints with reflected light.

          > You lunge for the Brigand and make a Wicked Slice with your own blade.

          â”€ Your Wicked Slice lands on the Brigand Cutthroat with a critical hit.

          The brigand cries out and falls back, clutching at his chest.
          Blood seeps between his fingers and he grunts, "Aaaargh!"

          > You yell "Now, Reynauld! Dispatch him with your Holy Smite!"

          - Reynauld's Holy Smite incinerates the Brigand Cutthroat with holy fire!

          Reynauld raises his hands and a blinding flash of white light envelops the brigand.
          His flesh boils and splits. A putrid smell rises from the corpse.

          "Aaaaaagh!"

          The brigand roars and staggers back, dropping one of his knives. The other clatters to the ground.
          The brigand's eyes roll back into his head and he collapses to the ground.

          > You say "Well done, Reynauld, let's see what curio or treasure he has."

          Reynauld kneels beside the body. He pulls off the brigand's cloak and then removes the brigand's belt.

          As he lifts the brigand's arms, a silver ring glimmers on his finger.

          > You ask "Ah, what is that?"

          "It's a signet ring," Reynauld replies. "They used to wear them as badges of office.
          If you have a special ability, you'd mark it with a symbol."

          "That must be a powerful item, then. What does it do?"

          "I don't know. But I'll keep it for now."

          Reynauld pockets the ring and stands up. He looks around, and then nods. "Let's move on."

          > You move on.

          Location: The Old Road, End of Corridor

          You move on with Reynauld, and find a portal deeper into the woods.
          Stepping in, you are surprised by a Brigand Bloodletter, and a Brigand Fusiliers!
          They stand guard over a large strongbox.
