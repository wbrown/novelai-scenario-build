          - Brigands

        text: >
          The Brigands are hardened bandits and killers that the Ancestor hired as a
          mercenary army to retake the Hamlet after the people rebelled against him.
          Once the Ancestor died and no further payment seemed in sight, those same
          mercenaries turned to banditry, and they can be found raiding any of the
          areas surrounding the Hamlet. Expect no quarter from them, and offer none.

          The Undead are twisted creatures defy the natural order by their mere existence,
          often by being animated (or reanimated) by dark forces or by men tampering with
          supernatural forces. Undead, Wraiths, and Ghouls are just a few of the macabre
          horde of Unholy horrors with deep hatred for the Light and all that lives in its
          loving embrace. Unholy creatures commonly have a high enough resistance to Bleed
          to be virtually immune; however, the corrosion that Blight provides will decay
          their abominable bodies back into the dust.

          the Weald; The Fungal Scratchers and Artillery are humans and corpses resurrected and
          controlled by the otherworldly spores. They are driven by the sole desire to spread the
          infective mushroom that have taken over their bodies. While the Unclean Giants still cling
          to live, they are often accompanied and controlled by the Crones who have taken up residence in the Weald.

        text: >
          The Cultists of these lands worship an Eldritch god. Revelation of the crawling
          chaos and the entity slumbering below has a rather curious effect on the minds of men.
          For most individuals these realizations irreparably twist and warp their minds, ceaselessly
          tormenting them until they eventually descend into insanity. However, for a few individuals,
          instead of madness these revelations inspire fanatical devotion. These zealots have flocked to
          the Estate to worship the nascent god and have completely given themselves over to it in mind,
          body and soul. They are ready, willing and eager to lay down their lives to protect it and 
          those who worship it as well.

        text: >
          The Pelagic are a race of ancient fishmen that live in the cove.
          They were roused by the activity around their home, making it a habit to sink
          and kill any sailors that come near their domain. They pose a great threat to the marine
          shipments of provisions that the Hamlet relies on.

        text: >
          The Drowned were once a a crew of particularly unsavory mariners,
          who sailed the four corners at the Ancestor's behest. When they increased their tariffs,
          he prepared an alternative payment. The ancestor hexed their anchor with every twisted
          incantation he could muster and dragged craft and crew to the swirling depth. But it was not their end;
          They managed to return to the surface - a Ghost Ship seeking vengeance.

        text: >
          Once a court of nobles who reigned alongside the Ancestor in his formative years.
          An unpleasant encounter has transformed them into sinister creatures enthralled to
          their need for 'The Blood'. They dwell within The Courtyard, once a palatial sanctuary
          for the aristocracy that ruled over the Hamlet, Now sunken into the swamp. These grotesque
          creatures thrive within its virulent waters. They are consumed by their hunger, although
          they still cultivate a veneer of the humanity that has long since been lost. But the veneer
          is just that, and a few sips of blood will bring out the monsters that lurk within.
