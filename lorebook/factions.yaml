          The Brigands are hardened bandits and killers that the Ancestor hired as a
          mercenary army to retake the Hamlet after the people rebelled against him.
          Once the Ancestor died and no further payment seemed in sight, those same
          mercenaries turned to banditry, and they can be found raiding any of the
          areas surrounding the Hamlet. Expect no quarter from them, and offer none.

          The Undead are twisted creatures defy the natural order by their mere existence,
          often by being animated (or reanimated) by dark forces or by men tampering with
          supernatural forces. Undead, Wraiths, and Ghouls are just a few of the macabre
          horde of Unholy horrors with deep hatred for the Light and all that lives in its
          loving embrace. Unholy creatures commonly have a high enough resistance to Bleed
          to be virtually immune; however, the corrosion that Blight provides will decay
          their abominable bodies back into the dust.

          The Fungal represent the twisted corruption by the fungous infection spread throughout
          the Weald; The Fungal Scratchers and Artillery are humans and corpses resurrected and
          controlled by the otherworldly spores. They are driven by the sole desire to spread the
          infective mushroom that have taken over their bodies. While the Unclean Giants still cling
          to live, they are often accompanied and controlled by the Crones who have taken up residence in the Weald.
