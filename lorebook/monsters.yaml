          - Heart of Darkness
        text: >
          The Heart of Darkness symbolizes the pinnacle of the Ancestor's
          ambitions, and represents the embodiment of the mystical forces that
          were responsible for the corruption of the Hamlet and its surroundings.
          In true Lovecraftian style, it is a slumbering, ethereal, and
          omnipresent deity manifested through the Ancestor's misdeeds, whose
          form became a vessel for the creature to cross over. It is the being
          that is revered by the cultists and priests of the Darkest Dungeon who
          have, under the influence of its cosmic power, become distorted
          entities of multiple mouths, eyes, and tentacled appendages. So
          terrible is its influence that the inhabitants of the Hamlet will
          appear momentarily disfigured in similar fashion to the Darkest Dungeon
          fiends after one has entered it and escaped.
