        keys:
          - Heart of Darkness
        text: >
          The Heart of Darkness symbolizes the pinnacle of the Ancestor's
          ambitions, and represents the embodiment of the mystical forces that
          were responsible for the corruption of the Hamlet and its surroundings.
          In true Lovecraftian style, it is a slumbering, ethereal, and
          omnipresent deity manifested through the Ancestor's misdeeds, whose
          form became a vessel for the creature to cross over. It is the being
          that is revered by the cultists and priests of the Darkest Dungeon who
          have, under the influence of its cosmic power, become distorted
          entities of multiple mouths, eyes, and tentacled appendages. So
          terrible is its influence that the inhabitants of the Hamlet will
          appear momentarily disfigured in similar fashion to the Darkest Dungeon
          fiends after one has entered it and escaped.

      "Undead: Bone Rabble":
        keys:
          - Bone Rabbles
          - Rabble
        text: >
          The Bone Rabble is an Unholy-type enemy that can be found in almost
          any area, although it is most common in the Ruins. It is often
          encountered in pairs, with both individuals taking up the first two
          ranks.
          
          With low HP, no protection, low speed, very poor resistances (save
          for bleed), and weak, inaccurate attacks, this enemy is by far the
          weakest of all Unholy enemies and should be considered a very low
          priority in battle. Its main purpose is to use its body (or corpse)
          to protect enemies in the back of the formation, although its Bump
          in the Night attack can reduce the victim's Dodge abilities by a
          fairly significant amount.

        text: >
          Bone Soldiers are common Unholy footsoldiers that are found within
          the Ruins. Unlike the Bone Rabble, Bone Soldiers are better-armored
          and wield more effective weapons, letting them hit harder and last
          longer on the battlefield. Still, they remain relatively weak and are
          easily dispatched.

      "Undead: Bone Courtier":
        keys:
          - Bone Courtiers
          - Courtier
        text: >
          The Bone Courtier is an enemy found in the Ruins, and often the first
          type that adventurers encounters which is specialized for dealing
          Stress damage. As the names of their more advanced forms indicate,
          these were likely nobles and even royalty in life, though of an
          unclear association with the Ancestor or his family. Though
          ill-suited for combat, their signature Tempting Goblet is a
          well-known source of Stress to adventuring parties.
 
          The Bone Courtier is an Unholy enemy that appears in the halls of
          the Ruins along with his fellow undead. The Bone Courtier always
          appears at the back of an Unholy party. As long as he is in ranks 3
          and 4, he continuously uses Tempting Goblet: a ranged attack that can
          hit any rank of the player's party that deals low health damage,
          while inflicting heavy stress. Since Stress damage is harder to heal
          than health, leaving the Bone Courtier free to act will endanger the
          rest of the mission with the threat of affliction, especially if
          encountered early in longer expeditions.

        text: >
          The crystalline Foremen are Husk type enemies found only in the
          Farmstead. They will typically appear alongside Farmhands, and have
          unique buffs that are only used when a Farmhand is present, enhancing
          their allies' combat abilities immensely.

        keys:
          - Fungal Scratchers
          - Scratcher
        text: >
          Fungal Scratchers are a common enemy found in the Weald. Likely a
          lost explorer transformed by the fungal infestation that lingers in
          the woods, these zombies can take a surprising amount of punishment
          while they poison anything they scratch. While they are more annoying
          than dangerous on their own, several of the Weald's inhabitants can
          cause the Scratchers to focus their attacks, turning them into
          deadlier fighters.

          - Artillery
        text: >
          The Weald's corruption does not restrict itself to transforming live
          subjects. While live humans become Fungal Scratchers, infected
          corpses are twisted into the Fungal Artillery. Though not as
          well-armored or resilient as the Scratchers, the Fungal Artillery
          possesses more potent poisons and carries the ability to mark
          heroes for its Scratcher companions to attack, while operating from
          the safety of the enemy back ranks.

      "Brigands: Brigand Bloodletter":
        keys:
          - Brigand Bloodletter
          - Bloodletters
        text: >
          The Brigand Bloodletter is a hulking, battle-scarred brute who
          typically shields his smaller allies. Armed with a vicious cat o'
          nine tails whip and a deadly flintlock pistol, he is ready to give
          his enemies deep and bloody scars to match his.
          
          The Brigand Bloodletter is always found accompanied by a Cutthroat or
          a Fusilier. While his primary role is to soak up melee damage for his
          allies and soften foes with widespread bleeding, his uncommon but
          devastating Point Blank Shot can inflict massive damage, even more so
          with a fearsome critical chance. Furthermore, should his Rain of
          Whips critically hit, your party will suffer a lot of stress on top
          of bleeding.

      "Brigands: Brigand Cutthroat":
        keys:
          - Brigand Cutthroat
          - Cutthroats
        text: >
          The Brigand Cutthroat is masterfully skilled with his blades, and
          able to deliver deadly thrusts that can easily decimate even the
          toughest of adventuring parties. Underestimate him at your own peril.
          
          While fragile with low health and negligible protection, the Brigand
          Cutthroat have a high chance to land critical hits, and as such can
          easily decimate even the healthiest of parties. They usually appear
          together with a Brigand Bloodletter and Brigand Fusilier each, or as
          a pair with 2 Brigand Fusiliers.

      "Brigands: Brigand Fusilier":
        keys:
          - Brigand Fusilier
          - Fusiliers
        text: >
          The Brigand Fusilier is armed with a blunderbuss which he uses to
          suppress the bandits' foes with sprays of lead. His attacks also make
          it harder for your heroes to dodge, allowing the Brigand Cutthroats
          or Brigand Bloodletter to come in close and wail upon your heroes
          with their blades and whip. Be wary and do not underestimate this
          opponent.
          
          With their high speed, the Brigand Fusilier will generally act early
          on in the initiative order, using Blanket Fire turn after turn to
          debuff all party members and lower their dodge slightly (so their
          allies will be more likely to land attacks). While their damage is
          fairly low, don't underestimate them: the damage and debuffs can
          start to add up quickly, and their attack poses a serious threat to
          anyone on Death's Door.
          
          Brigand Fusiliers are always positioned on the back of the enemy
          formation, away from the range of usual front-liners such as Leper or
          Crusader. Their low HP, however, makes them extremely easy to take
          down by heroes able to target the back rows, such as the Grave Robber,
          the Houndmaster, or the Hellion.
