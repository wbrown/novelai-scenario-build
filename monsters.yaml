          The Brigand Bloodletter is a hulking, battle-scarred brute who typically
          shields his smaller allies. Armed with a vicious cat o' nine tails whip
          and a deadly flintlock pistol, he is ready to give his enemies deep and
          bloody scars to match his.
          
          The Brigand Bloodletter is always found accompanied by a Cutthroat or
          a Fusilier. While his primary role is to protect his allies and soften
          foes with widespread bleeding, his uncommon Point Blank Shot can inflict
          massive wounds. Furthermore, he can dish out devastating Punishment with
          his whip, while and Rain of Whips causes massive lacerations on his targets.

          Brigand Cutthroats are masterfully skilled with their blades, and able to
          deliver deadly thrusts that can easily decimate even the toughest of
          adventuring parties. While the Brigand Cutthroats may look fragile with
          almost negligible protection, they have immense offensive capabilities.

          The Brigand Cutthroat will usually start by weakening their opposition using
          Slice And Dice attacks, before exploiting it with Shank. The Brigand Cutthroat
          will use Uppercut Slice to push enemies back, should he feel threatened enough.
          Finally, if he can't find a good opening for an attack, he will use Harmless
          Poke in an attempt to close to gap to his target.

        text: >
          Brigand Fusiliers are armed with a blunderbuss which they use to suppress the
          bandits' foes with sprays of lead. Their attacks also make it harder for you
          dodge, allowing other Brigands to close the gap and wail upon your heroes with
          their blades and whips. Be wary and do not underestimate this opponent.

          The Brigand Fusilier is incredibily nimble and often the first one to act. He
          uses Blanket Fire at every opportunity he gets. If the Fusilier finds himself
          face to face with an opponent, he will use Rushed Shot to retreat to the safety
          of the backline to continue his assault from there.

        text: >
          The Bone Rabble is an Unholy-type enemy that can be found in almost
          any area, although it is most common in the Ruins. It is often
          encountered in pairs, with both individuals taking up the first two
          ranks.
          
          With low HP, no protection, low speed, very poor resistances (save
          for bleed), and weak, inaccurate attacks, this enemy is by far the
          weakest of all Unholy enemies and should be considered a very low
          priority in battle. Its main purpose is to use its body (or corpse)
          to protect enemies in the back of the formation, although its Bump
          in the Night attack can reduce the victim's Dodge abilities by a
          fairly significant amount.

          Bone Soldiers are common Unholy footsoldiers that are found within
          the Ruins. Unlike the Bone Rabble, Bone Soldiers are better-armored
          and wield more effective weapons, letting them hit harder and last
          longer on the battlefield. Still, they remain relatively weak and are
          easily dispatched.

        text: >
          The Bone Courtier is an enemy found in the Ruins, and often the first
          type that adventurers encounters which is specialized for dealing
          Stress damage. As the names of their more advanced forms indicate,
          these were likely nobles and even royalty in life, though of an
          unclear association with the Ancestor or his family. Though
          ill-suited for combat, their signature Tempting Goblet is a
          well-known source of Stress to adventuring parties.
 
          The Bone Courtier is an Unholy enemy that appears in the halls of
          the Ruins along with his fellow undead. The Bone Courtier always
          appears at the back of an Unholy party. As long as he is in ranks 3
          and 4, he continuously uses Tempting Goblet: a ranged attack that can
          hit any rank of the player's party that deals low health damage,
          while inflicting heavy stress. Since Stress damage is harder to heal
          than health, leaving the Bone Courtier free to act will endanger the
          rest of the mission with the threat of affliction, especially if
          encountered early in longer expeditions.

        text: >
          The Bone Captains are tough, heavy-hitting front-line attackers
          clad in armor and wielding a mace. In life they stood as veterans
          of war leading the charge and in death they play largely the same
          role. The weight of their strikes can cause the very ground to quake,
          leaving those affected dazed and reeling.

          Its main ability is Ground Pound, a mighty smash that will shake the
          very foundation beneath your feet. Sometimes it can perform a Crushing
          Blow at those in it's reach, leaving their target disoriented from the
          heavy impact.

        text: >
          Bone Arbalists operate by firing crossbow bolts into the fray from the
          safety of the back ranks, and end up in an awkward position if drawn to
          the front.

          The Bone Arbalist will use his Quarrel ability while in the rear ranks,
          able to snipe off any opposition. This attack is already quite powerful
          on its own, but is especially devastating to targets that have been Marked.
          It will use a Bayonet Jab to retreat to the back, should it find itself
          face-to-face with an enemy.
