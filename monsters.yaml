          The Brigand Bloodletter is a hulking, battle-scarred brute who typically
          shields his smaller allies. Armed with a vicious cat o' nine tails whip
          and a deadly flintlock pistol, he is ready to give his enemies deep and
          bloody scars to match his.
          
          The Brigand Bloodletter is always found accompanied by a Cutthroat or
          a Fusilier. While his primary role is to protect his allies and soften
          foes with widespread bleeding, his uncommon Point Blank Shot can inflict
          massive wounds. Furthermore, he can dish out devastating Punishment with
          his whip, while and Rain of Whips causes massive lacerations on his targets.

          Brigand Cutthroats are masterfully skilled with their blades, and able to
          deliver deadly thrusts that can easily decimate even the toughest of
          adventuring parties. While the Brigand Cutthroats may look fragile with
          almost negligible protection, they have immense offensive capabilities.

          The Brigand Cutthroat will usually start by weakening their opposition using
          Slice And Dice attacks, before exploiting it with Shank. The Brigand Cutthroat
          will use Uppercut Slice to push enemies back, should he feel threatened enough.
          Finally, if he can't find a good opening for an attack, he will use Harmless
          Poke in an attempt to close to gap to his target.

          Brigand Fusiliers are armed with a blunderbuss which they use to suppress the
          bandits' foes with sprays of lead. Their attacks also make it harder for you
          dodge, allowing other Brigands to close the gap and wail upon your heroes with
          their blades and whips. Be wary and do not underestimate this opponent.

          The Brigand Fusilier is incredibily nimble and often the first one to act. He
          uses Blanket Fire at every opportunity he gets. If the Fusilier finds himself
          face to face with an opponent, he will use Rushed Shot to retreat to the safety
          of the backline to continue his assault from there.

        text: >
          Bone Rabbles are by far the weakest of all Unholy enemies you might encounters.
          They usually don't pose a great threat and can be considered a very low priority
          in battle. Their main purpose is to use their bodies (or corpse) to protect their
          allies in the back.

          The Bone Rabble main attack is called Bump in the Night, where it clobbers it's
          target with a makeshift club. Should it be pushed back, it tries to use Tic-Toc
          to close the gap.

        text: >
          Bone Soldiers are the common footsoldiers of the Undead. They are sufficiently
          equipped to hit hard and last some time on the battlefield. Still, they remain
          relatively weak and are easily dispatched. The finesse it had in life persists
          in death, allowing them to strike with a farther reach than many other monsters.

          The Bone Soldier's main form of attack comes in the form of Graveyard Slash, a
          skilled strike with its rusted, but deadly, blade. When pushed back, it attempts
          to use Graveyard Stumble to get in reach for its weapon.

        text: >
          Bone Courtiers, as their names indicate, were likely nobles and
          even royalty in life, though of an unclear association with the Ancestor
          or his family. These courtiers prefer to stay in the back rows, wielding
          their signature goblets, whose contents is of most disturbing nature.

          The Bone Courtier, though ill-suited for combat, uses its signature
          Tempting Goblet to disturb even the most hardened adventurer. It's
          not their only means of attacking though. They do carry daggers to stab
          any of their targets who get too close with Knife in The Dark.

        text: >
          The Bone Captains are tough, heavy-hitting front-line attackers
          clad in armor and wielding a mace. In life they stood as veterans
          of war leading the charge and in death they play largely the same
          role. The weight of their strikes can cause the very ground to quake,
          leaving those affected dazed and reeling.

          Its main ability is Ground Pound, a mighty smash that will shake the
          very foundation beneath your feet. Sometimes it can perform a Crushing
          Blow at those in it's reach, leaving their target disoriented from the
          heavy impact.

        text: >
          Bone Arbalists operate by firing crossbow bolts into the fray from the
          safety of the back ranks, and end up in an awkward position if drawn to
          the front.

          The Bone Arbalist will use his Quarrel ability while in the rear ranks,
          able to snipe off any opposition. This attack is already quite powerful
          on its own, but is especially devastating to targets that have been Marked.
          It will use a Bayonet Jab to retreat to the back, should it find itself
          face-to-face with an enemy.
